Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

Date of Service: 2025-05-17

Reason for Visit  
Mr. John Smith presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, refractory to conservative management.

History  
The patient has experienced progressive left knee pain over the past five years, unresponsive to physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. He reports difficulty ambulating more than one block and morning stiffness lasting up to 45 minutes. No history of trauma or prior knee surgeries. Past medical history notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Preoperative Assessment  
Physical examination revealed antalgic gait, joint line tenderness, and crepitus on the left knee. Radiographs demonstrated tricompartmental osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. Preoperative labs were within normal limits. Cardiology clearance obtained.

Procedure Performed  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

Anesthesia  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation.

Findings  
Intraoperative findings included severe degenerative changes of the femoral and tibial articular surfaces, significant osteophyte formation, and synovial hypertrophy. No gross ligamentous instability was noted.

Operative Details  
The patient was positioned supine with a tourniquet applied to the left thigh. Standard medial parapatellar approach utilized. Osteophytes were excised, and the joint surfaces were prepared. Cemented prosthetic components (femoral, tibial, and patellar) were implanted with satisfactory alignment and fixation. Stability and range of motion were assessed intraoperatively and found to be excellent. Wound irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied.

Estimated Blood Loss: 250 mL  
No intraoperative complications.

Postoperative Plan  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with walker assistance  
- Initiate physical therapy on postoperative day 1  
- DVT prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin  
- Pain control with multimodal analgesia  
- Wound checks in 2 days and 2 weeks

Recommendations  
Continue post-operative rehabilitation and scheduled follow-up. Monitor for signs of infection, thromboembolic events, or prosthesis-related complications. Long-term prognosis is favorable with adherence to rehabilitation protocol.
