  sections:

      and recently diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
  - heading: History of Present Illness
    content: The patient reports experiencing intermittent episodes of palpitations
      over the past month, each lasting 5–10 minutes and typically occurring at rest.
      She denies chest pain, syncope, or shortness of breath. Blood pressure readings
      at home have ranged from 138–146/84–92 mmHg. She states adherence to her prescribed
      medications and has not noticed any adverse effects. No recent hospitalizations
      or emergency visits.
  - heading: Past Medical History
    content: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (diagnosed
      2 months ago), mild osteoarthritis.
  - heading: Assessment
    content: Ms. Hayes is a 62-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      and well-controlled hypertension. She continues to experience brief, self-limited
      episodes of palpitations without associated symptoms. No evidence of heart failure
      or ischemia. Blood pressure remains mildly elevated.
  - heading: Plan
    content: Continue current antihypertensive regimen (lisinopril 20 mg daily). Maintain
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for stroke prevention. Initiate low-dose metoprolol
      succinate (25 mg daily) to reduce frequency of palpitations. Encourage continued
      home blood pressure monitoring. Schedule follow-up in 3 months or sooner if
      symptoms worsen. Repeat ECG and basic labs at next visit.
