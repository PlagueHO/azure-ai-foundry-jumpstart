  title: Cardiology Clinic Follow-up Note
  sections:
  - heading: Reason for Visit/Consultation
    content: Ms. Emily Carter presents for follow-up evaluation of her hypertension
      and recently diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She was last seen in
      the clinic three months ago.
  - heading: History of Present Illness
    content: The patient reports intermittent palpitations, most noticeable over the
      past two weeks, occasionally accompanied by mild dizziness but no syncope. She
      denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity swelling. She has
      been compliant with her prescribed medications and has been monitoring her blood
      pressure at home, which has ranged between 128–142/84–92 mmHg.
  - heading: Past Medical History
    content: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (diagnosed
      6 months ago), and hypothyroidism.
  - heading: Assessment
    content: 54-year-old female with history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation, currently experiencing intermittent palpitations without evidence
      of hemodynamic compromise. Blood pressure remains moderately controlled. No
      signs of heart failure or ischemia.
  - heading: Plan
    content: Continue current antihypertensive regimen (lisinopril 20 mg daily). Continue
      apixaban 5 mg BID for stroke prevention. Initiate low-dose beta blocker (metoprolol
      tartrate 25 mg BID) to help control heart rate and palpitations. Schedule 24-hour
      Holter monitor to assess arrhythmia burden. Follow up in 3 months or sooner
      if symptoms worsen. Encourage ongoing lifestyle modifications and home blood
      pressure monitoring.
