Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. John Smith presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, refractory to conservative management.

**History:**  
The patient has experienced progressive left knee pain over the past 4 years, with marked worsening in the last 12 months. Conservative treatments including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections have failed to provide lasting relief. The patient reports difficulty ambulating and performing daily activities.

**Preoperative Assessment:**  
- Diagnosis: End-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee  
- Imaging: X-rays revealed severe tricompartmental narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis  
- No significant cardiac or pulmonary contraindications to surgery  
- Allergies: None reported  
- Preoperative labs within normal limits

**Procedure Performed:**  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Anesthesia:**  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation

**Operative Findings:**  
- Marked degeneration of articular cartilage in all three compartments  
- Osteophyte formation at femoral condyles and tibial plateau  
- No gross ligamentous instability  
- No evidence of infection or inflammatory arthropathy

**Procedure Details:**  
- Standard medial parapatellar approach used  
- Osteophytes excised, and bone surfaces prepared  
- Femoral and tibial components implanted using cemented technique  
- Patella resurfaced  
- Components placed in appropriate alignment  
- Wound irrigated and closed in layers  
- Hemostasis achieved  
- Sterile dressing applied  
- Estimated blood loss: 250 mL  
- No intraoperative complications

**Postoperative Plan:**  
- Admit to orthopaedic ward for routine postoperative care  
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy starting postoperative day 1  
- Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin  
- Pain management with multimodal analgesia  
- Monitor wound and neurovascular status

**Recommendations:**  
- Continue physiotherapy for range of motion and strengthening  
- Outpatient follow-up in 2 weeks  
- Monitor for signs of infection or deep vein thrombosis  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated
