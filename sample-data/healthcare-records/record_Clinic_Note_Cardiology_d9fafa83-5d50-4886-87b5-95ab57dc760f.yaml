  title: Cardiology Clinic Follow-up Note
  sections:
  - heading: Reason for Visit/Consultation
    content: Patient presents for a routine follow-up to monitor management of hypertension
      and evaluation of recent onset palpitations.
  - heading: History of Present Illness
    content: Ms. Turner reports experiencing intermittent palpitations over the past
      two weeks, described as a rapid, fluttering sensation in her chest, lasting
      a few minutes and resolving spontaneously. She denies chest pain, syncope, or
      shortness of breath. No recent changes in medication or lifestyle. Blood pressure
      readings at home have averaged 138/86 mmHg.
  - heading: Past Medical History
    content: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. No previous history
      of coronary artery disease or arrhythmias.
  - heading: Assessment
    content: Well-controlled hypertension. New onset palpitations, likely benign,
      but further workup is warranted to rule out arrhythmia. No evidence of heart
      failure or ischemic symptoms.
  - heading: Plan
    content: Obtain a 24-hour Holter monitor to assess for arrhythmias. Continue current
      antihypertensive and statin therapy. Encourage patient to record frequency and
      timing of palpitations. Follow-up appointment scheduled in four weeks or sooner
      if symptoms worsen. Advised to seek immediate care for chest pain, syncope,
      or severe shortness of breath.
