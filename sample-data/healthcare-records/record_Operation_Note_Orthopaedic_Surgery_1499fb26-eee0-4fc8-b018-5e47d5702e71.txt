Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Reason for Visit:**  
Patient presented with progressively worsening left knee pain and stiffness secondary to end-stage osteoarthritis, refractory to conservative management.

**History:**  
Mr. Smith has a 5-year history of left knee pain, aggravated by ambulation and weight-bearing. Conservative measures, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, have failed to provide lasting relief. No prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. No reported drug allergies. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension.

**Assessment:**  
Diagnosis: Left knee end-stage osteoarthritis  
Indication: Failure of non-surgical management, significant functional limitation, and radiographic evidence of joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation.

**Procedure:**  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Findings:**  
- Extensive degenerative changes of femoral and tibial articular surfaces  
- Significant osteophyte formation noted medially and laterally  
- Intact cruciate and collateral ligaments  
- No evidence of infection or gross deformity

**Operative Details:**  
- Patient placed under spinal anesthesia and positioned supine  
- Standard medial parapatellar approach utilized  
- Osteophytes excised, femoral and tibial surfaces prepared  
- Cemented total knee prosthesis implanted with satisfactory alignment and stability  
- Patella resurfaced  
- Hemostasis achieved, wound closed in layers  
- Sterile dressing applied  
- Procedure duration: 1 hour, 45 minutes  
- Estimated blood loss: 250 mL

**Complications:**  
None encountered intraoperatively.

**Recommendations / Postoperative Plan:**  
- Begin physiotherapy on postoperative day 1  
- DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin  
- Pain management with multimodal analgesia  
- Wound inspection in 48 hours  
- Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic in 2 weeks for suture removal and assessment
