        "content": "The patient reports a 3-month history of episodic chest tightness, described as a pressure-like sensation, primarily occurring during moderate physical activity. Episodes last approximately 5â€“10 minutes and are occasionally accompanied by mild palpitations and shortness of breath. She denies syncope, orthopnea, or lower extremity edema. Over-the-counter antacids have not provided relief. No recent upper respiratory infections or trauma."

        "heading": "Assessment",
        "content": "Ms. Doe is a 35-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presents with exertional chest discomfort and palpitations. Physical examination and baseline ECG in clinic were unremarkable. Given the persistence of symptoms and family history of premature coronary artery disease, further cardiac evaluation is warranted to rule out underlying ischemic or structural heart disease."

Recommend continuation of current activity level with avoidance of strenuous exertion until further evaluation. Patient has been advised to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen or if she experiences chest pain at rest, syncope, or severe shortness of breath."
