        "heading": "History of Present Illness",
        "content": "The patient reports a six-month history of intermittent pain and swelling affecting the small joints of her hands and wrists, particularly in the morning. She describes morning stiffness lasting over an hour and recent difficulty performing tasks that require fine motor skills. There is no significant history of trauma, recent infections, or family history of autoimmune disease. Over-the-counter analgesics have provided minimal relief."

        "heading": "Assessment",
        "content": "On examination, there is notable synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. Laboratory results show mild elevation of ESR and CRP, with negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies. X-rays of the hands show no erosive changes. The findings are suggestive of an early inflammatory arthropathy, possibly seronegative rheumatoid arthritis."
