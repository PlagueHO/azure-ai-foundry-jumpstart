  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient sustained a fall onto an outstretched hand resulting in a displaced
      distal radius fracture. Surgical intervention indicated due to instability and
      displacement.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia administered without complications.
  - heading: Operative Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced distal radius fracture with minimal articular
      involvement. No gross neurovascular injury noted.
  - heading: Procedure Description
    content: The patient was positioned supine with the left arm on an arm board.
      After prepping and draping in sterile fashion, a volar approach to the distal
      radius was performed. Fracture fragments were identified and reduced anatomically.
      A volar locking plate was applied and secured with screws. Fluoroscopy confirmed
      satisfactory reduction and hardware position. The wound was irrigated and closed
      in layers. Sterile dressing and a volar splint were applied.
