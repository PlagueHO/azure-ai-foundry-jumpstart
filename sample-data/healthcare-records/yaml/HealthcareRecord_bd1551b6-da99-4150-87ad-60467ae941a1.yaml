  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented following a mechanical fall with pain, swelling, and
      deformity of the left wrist. X-rays confirmed a comminuted, displaced distal
      radius fracture. Operative intervention was recommended due to displacement
      and instability.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: Regional block (axillary) with sedation.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted fracture of distal radius with dorsal displacement. Soft tissues
      intact. No neurovascular compromise noted intraoperatively.
  - heading: Procedure Details
    content: The patient was positioned supine with the left arm on an arm table.
      The limb was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A longitudinal
      incision was made over the volar aspect of the distal radius. Dissection was
      carried down to the fracture site. The fracture fragments were identified, reduced
      under direct vision, and provisional fixation was achieved with K-wires. A volar
      locking plate was then applied and fixed with appropriate screws. Fluoroscopy
      confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware placement. The wound was irrigated,
      hemostasis achieved, and the incision closed in layers. Sterile dressing and
      volar splint were applied.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: Approximately 30 mL.
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery
      in stable condition. Postoperative instructions given. Follow-up in orthopaedic
      clinic in 10-14 days.
