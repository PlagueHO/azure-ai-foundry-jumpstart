  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Indication
    content: 'The patient is a 62-year-old female who sustained a displaced left distal
      radius fracture following a fall on an outstretched hand. Non-operative management
      was deemed unsuitable due to significant displacement and articular involvement.

      '
  - heading: Procedure
    content: 'Under general anesthesia and with the patient in the supine position,
      the left upper limb was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. A standard volar
      approach to the distal radius was performed. The fracture fragments were visualized,
      reduced under direct vision, and temporarily stabilized with K-wires. A volar
      locking plate was then applied and fixed with appropriate screws. Fluoroscopy
      confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware positioning.

      '
  - heading: Findings
    content: 'Comminuted extra-articular distal radius fracture with no intra-articular
      extension. No neurovascular injury identified.

      '
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 50 mL.
  - heading: Complications
    content: None encountered intraoperatively.
  - heading: Postoperative Plan
    content: 'The left upper limb was placed in a volar splint. The patient will be
      monitored for neurovascular compromise and instructed to keep the limb elevated.
      Follow-up scheduled in 2 weeks for wound check and radiographic evaluation.
