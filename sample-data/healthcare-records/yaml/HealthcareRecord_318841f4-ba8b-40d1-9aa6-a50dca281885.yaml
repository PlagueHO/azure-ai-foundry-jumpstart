  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist (unchanged).
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius.
  - heading: Indications
    content: The patient sustained a left distal radius fracture following a fall
      on an outstretched hand. X-rays confirmed a displaced extra-articular fracture.
      Due to displacement and functional demands, operative intervention was indicated.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia.
  - heading: Operative Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius. No neurovascular
      injury noted.
  - heading: Procedure Details
    content: The patient was positioned supine with the left arm on an arm board.
      After prepping and draping, a standard volar approach was made to the distal
      radius. Fracture site was exposed, hematoma evacuated, and fracture fragments
      reduced under direct visualization. A volar locking plate was applied and secured
      with screws. Fracture reduction and hardware placement were confirmed with intraoperative
      fluoroscopy. Wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied
      and a volar splint placed.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 30 mL
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery
      in stable condition.
