  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (confirmed intraoperatively)
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius with volar
      locking plate
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented following a fall on an outstretched hand, resulting
      in a displaced distal radius fracture. Given the degree of displacement and
      failure of closed reduction, operative management was indicated.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia
  - heading: Operative Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced distal radius fracture with minimal articular
      step-off. No associated neurovascular injury.
  - heading: Procedure Details
    content: 'The patient was placed supine with the left upper limb on an arm table.
      After prepping and draping in the usual sterile fashion, a standard volar approach
      to the distal radius was made. Fracture fragments were identified and carefully
      mobilized. Reduction was achieved and provisionally held with K-wires. A volar
      locking plate was applied and secured with screws. Intraoperative fluoroscopy
      confirmed anatomic reduction and satisfactory hardware placement. Wound was
      irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing and volar splint applied.
