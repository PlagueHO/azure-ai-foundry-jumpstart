  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Indication
    content: Patient presented with a displaced distal radius fracture following a
      fall on an outstretched hand. Conservative management was deemed unsuitable
      due to significant displacement and articular involvement.
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Under general anesthesia, the left upper limb was prepped and draped
      in the usual sterile fashion. A standard volar approach to the distal radius
      was performed. The fracture site was exposed, hematoma evacuated, and the fragments
      reduced anatomically. Fixation was achieved using a volar locking plate and
      screws. Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory alignment and hardware placement.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement. No intra-articular
      step-off post-reduction. No evidence of associated neurovascular injury.
  - heading: Closure
    content: Wound irrigated and closed in layers with absorbable sutures. Sterile
      dressing applied. Arm placed in a volar splint.
  - heading: Postoperative Plan
    content: Elevate limb, monitor neurovascular status, and commence early finger
      mobilization. Analgesia and prophylactic antibiotics prescribed. Outpatient
      review in one week for wound check and radiographs.
