  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (same as pre-op).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius using
      volar locking plate.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional block.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented after a fall with pain, swelling, and deformity of
      the left wrist. Imaging confirmed a displaced distal radius fracture. Surgical
      intervention was indicated due to the degree of displacement and instability.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced distal radius fracture without neurovascular
      compromise.
  - heading: Technique
    content: After appropriate anesthesia and prepping of the left upper extremity,
      a volar approach to the distal radius was performed. Fracture fragments were
      reduced and provisional fixation achieved with K-wires. A volar locking plate
      was then applied and secured with locking screws. Fluoroscopic imaging confirmed
      satisfactory alignment and hardware placement. Wound was irrigated and closed
      in layers. Sterile dressing applied, and a volar splint placed.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 50 mL
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient was stable and transferred to recovery in good condition.
