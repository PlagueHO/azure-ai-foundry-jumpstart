  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced distal radius fracture, left wrist (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius with
      volar locking plate.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented with pain, swelling, and deformity of the left wrist
      following a fall. X-rays revealed a displaced distal radius fracture. Non-operative
      management was deemed insufficient due to displacement and instability.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional block.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: Patient was positioned supine with the left arm on an arm table. The
      limb was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A volar approach to
      the distal radius was made. The fracture was identified and reduced under direct
      visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. A volar locking plate was applied and
      secured with screws. Satisfactory alignment and fixation were confirmed with
      intraoperative imaging. Wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing
      applied. Patient tolerated the procedure well.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: Minimal (<50 mL).
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient transferred to recovery in stable condition with neurovascularly
      intact left hand. Postoperative instructions given.
