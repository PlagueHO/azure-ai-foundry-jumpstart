  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture following a fall.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left distal radius.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional nerve block.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented with a closed, displaced distal radius fracture after
      a mechanical fall. Nonoperative management was deemed inadequate due to displacement
      and instability.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: 'The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the
      table. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
      fashion. A longitudinal incision was made over the volar aspect of the left
      wrist. Dissection was carried down to the fracture site, taking care to protect
      neurovascular structures. The fracture fragments were identified, reduced anatomically,
      and provisional fixation was achieved with K-wires. A volar locking plate was
      then applied and fixed with screws. Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory reduction
      and hardware placement. The wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile
      dressing and a volar splint were applied.
