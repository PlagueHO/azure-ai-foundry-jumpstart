  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Indication
    content: 'The patient presented with a closed, displaced distal radius fracture
      following a fall from standing height. Indicated for operative management due
      to loss of alignment and functional displacement.

      '
  - heading: Procedure
    content: 'Under general anesthesia, a volar approach to the distal radius was
      performed. Fracture fragments were identified, reduced under direct visualization,
      and provisionally stabilized. A volar locking plate was contoured and applied
      to the distal radius. Screw fixation achieved stable construct. Fluoroscopy
      confirmed anatomic reduction and hardware placement. Wound irrigated and closed
      in layers. Sterile dressing applied. No intraoperative complications.

      '
  - heading: Findings
    content: 'Comminuted distal radius fracture with involvement of the articular
      surface. Good reduction and stable fixation achieved.

      '
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 50 mL
  - heading: Postoperative Plan
    content: 'Wrist immobilized in volar splint. Elevation and neurovascular checks
      advised. Analgesia as needed. Follow-up in 10-14 days for wound review and suture
      removal. Early range of motion to be started as tolerated.
