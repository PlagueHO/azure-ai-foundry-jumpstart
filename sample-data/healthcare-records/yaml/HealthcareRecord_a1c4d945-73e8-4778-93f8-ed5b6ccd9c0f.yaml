  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (confirmed intraoperatively).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius using
      volar locking plate.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient sustained a left wrist fracture following a fall at home. Imaging
      confirmed a displaced distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation, necessitating
      surgical intervention for optimal alignment and function.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional block.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally angulated distal radius fracture. No gross ligamentous
      injury. Ulnar styloid intact.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room
      and placed supine on the table. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped
      in a sterile fashion. A standard volar approach to the distal radius was performed.
      Fracture fragments were identified, reduced under direct visualization, and
      provisional fixation obtained with K-wires. A volar locking plate was applied
      and secured with screws. Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware
      placement. Wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing and volar
      splint applied.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 30 mL
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient tolerated procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable
      condition.
