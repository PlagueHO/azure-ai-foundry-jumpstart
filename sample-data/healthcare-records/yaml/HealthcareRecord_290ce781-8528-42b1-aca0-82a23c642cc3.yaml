  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (confirmed intraoperatively).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left distal radius
      using volar locking plate.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient sustained a fall onto an outstretched hand resulting in a displaced
      distal radius fracture, requiring surgical fixation due to instability and articular
      involvement.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional block.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement. No evidence
      of median nerve entrapment. Articular surface was satisfactorily reduced.
  - heading: Procedure Details
    content: The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
      manner. A volar approach to the distal radius was performed. Fracture fragments
      were identified, reduced anatomically, and stabilized with a volar locking plate
      and screws. Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory alignment and
      hardware placement. The wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing
      was applied and a volar splint was placed.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 30 mL
  - heading: Complications
    content: None encountered.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition with neurovascularly
      intact left hand.
