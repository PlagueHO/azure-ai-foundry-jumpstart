  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius using
      volar locking plate.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient sustained a fall onto an outstretched hand resulting in a displaced
      distal radius fracture. Nonoperative management was deemed unsuitable due to
      significant displacement and instability.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced distal radius fracture with minimal intra-articular
      extension. No neurovascular injury identified.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating
      room and placed supine on the table. The left upper extremity was prepped and
      draped in the usual sterile fashion. A standard volar approach was made to the
      distal radius. Fracture fragments were identified and reduced under direct visualization
      and fluoroscopic guidance. A volar locking plate was applied and secured with
      appropriate screws. Good alignment was confirmed fluoroscopically. Hemostasis
      was achieved, and the wound was closed in layers. Sterile dressing was applied
      and a volar splint placed.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 50 mL.
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred in stable
      condition to the recovery unit.
