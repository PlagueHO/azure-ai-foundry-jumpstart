  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (same as preoperative).
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left distal radius
      using a volar locking plate.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia.
  - heading: Indications
    content: The patient sustained a left distal radius fracture following a fall
      on an outstretched hand. Imaging revealed significant displacement, warranting
      surgical intervention.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted, dorsally displaced left distal radius fracture with intra-articular
      extension.
  - heading: Procedure Details
    content: After induction of anesthesia and application of a sterile tourniquet,
      the left upper extremity was prepped and draped. A standard volar approach to
      the distal radius was performed. Fracture fragments were identified, reduced
      under direct visualization, and provisionally stabilized with K-wires. A volar
      locking plate was applied and fixed with appropriate screws. Fluoroscopic imaging
      confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware placement. Wound was irrigated
      and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 20 mL
  - heading: Complications
    content: None.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition with neurovascularly
      intact left hand.
