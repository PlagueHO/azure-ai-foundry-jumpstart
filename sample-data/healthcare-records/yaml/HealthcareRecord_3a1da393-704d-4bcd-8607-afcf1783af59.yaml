  - heading: Details of Procedure
    content: 'The patient was positioned supine with left arm on a hand table. After
      prepping and draping, a standard volar approach was made to the distal radius.
      Fracture fragments were identified and reduced under fluoroscopic guidance.
      A volar locking plate was applied and secured with screws. Fracture alignment
      and hardware position were confirmed fluoroscopically. Wound was irrigated and
      closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied and a volar splint placed.
