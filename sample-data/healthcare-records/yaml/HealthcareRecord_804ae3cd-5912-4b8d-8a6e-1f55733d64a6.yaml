  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius
  sections:
  - heading: Indication
    content: 'The patient presented following a fall at home with pain and deformity
      of the left wrist. Radiographs confirmed a displaced distal radius fracture.
      After discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient consented
      to surgical intervention.

      '
  - heading: Procedure
    content: 'Under general anesthesia, the left upper limb was prepped and draped.
      A volar approach to the distal radius was utilized. Fracture fragments were
      visualized, reduced anatomically, and provisionally held with K-wires. A volar
      locking plate was then applied and fixed with appropriate screws. Fluoroscopy
      confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware placement. Wound was irrigated
      and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. No immediate complications.

      '
  - heading: Postoperative Plan
    content: 'The patient will be placed in a volar splint and started on early finger
      mobilization. Analgesia and neurovascular monitoring will be instituted. Outpatient
      review in 10-14 days for wound check and suture removal.
