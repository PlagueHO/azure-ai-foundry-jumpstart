  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Indication
    content: The patient presented with a closed, displaced left distal radius fracture
      following a fall from standing height. Surgical intervention was indicated due
      to significant displacement and loss of alignment.
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with the
      left arm on a hand table. A standard volar approach to the distal radius was
      performed. Fracture fragments were identified, reduced anatomically, and provisionally
      stabilized with K-wires. A volar locking plate was then applied and secured
      with screws. Fluoroscopic imaging confirmed satisfactory reduction and hardware
      placement.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation. No intra-articular
      extension. Reduction achieved with restoration of radial height and alignment.
  - heading: Complications
    content: No intraoperative complications encountered. Estimated blood loss less
      than 50 mL.
  - heading: Postoperative Plan
    content: The left arm was placed in a volar splint. Patient to remain non-weight
      bearing on the left wrist. Analgesia as needed. Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic
      in 2 weeks for wound check and radiographs.
