  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture (unchanged).
  - heading: Procedure
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius with volar
      locking plate.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia administered without complications.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient presented after a fall with significant pain, deformity, and
      loss of function in the left wrist. Radiographs confirmed a displaced distal
      radius fracture requiring surgical intervention.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Intraoperative findings confirmed comminution and displacement of the
      distal radius. No neurovascular compromise was noted.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: The patient was placed supine with the left arm on a hand table. The
      limb was exsanguinated and a tourniquet inflated. A standard volar approach
      to the distal radius was utilized. Fracture fragments were visualized and anatomically
      reduced. A volar locking plate was applied and secured with locking screws.
      Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory alignment and fixation. Wound was irrigated
      and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. Tourniquet was deflated and
      hemostasis confirmed.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: Approximate blood loss was less than 50 mL.
  - heading: Complications
    content: No intraoperative complications.
  - heading: Disposition
    content: Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery
      in stable condition.
