  title: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Left Distal Radius Fracture
  sections:
  - heading: Preoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Postoperative Diagnosis
    content: Displaced left distal radius fracture.
  - heading: Procedure Performed
    content: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left distal radius with
      volar locking plate.
  - heading: Anesthesia
    content: General anesthesia with regional block.
  - heading: Indications
    content: Patient sustained a left distal radius fracture following a fall. Due
      to displacement and instability, surgical intervention was indicated to restore
      alignment and function.
  - heading: Findings
    content: Comminuted, displaced fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation.
      No intra-articular extension.
  - heading: Description of Procedure
    content: The patient was placed supine on the operating table, and the left upper
      extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A volar approach
      to the distal radius was utilized. Fracture fragments were identified and reduced
      under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. A volar locking plate
      was applied and fixed with appropriate screws. Adequate reduction and hardware
      placement were confirmed with intraoperative fluoroscopy. The wound was irrigated
      and closed in layers. A sterile dressing and volar splint were applied.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: 20 mL
  - heading: Complications
