  - heading: Details of Procedure
    content: Patient was placed supine on the operating table with the left arm on
      a hand table. The left upper limb was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
      fashion. A volar approach to the distal radius was made via the Henry approach.
      Fracture fragments were identified and reduced under direct vision and fluoroscopic
      guidance. A volar locking plate was applied and fixed with locking screws. Satisfactory
      reduction and hardware position confirmed intraoperatively. Wound irrigated
      and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. No intraoperative complications.
  - heading: Estimated Blood Loss
    content: Approximately 30 mL.
  - heading: Specimens
