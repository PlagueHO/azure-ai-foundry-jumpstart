    content: 'The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine
      position. After appropriate anesthesia was administered, the left lower extremity
      was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A midline skin incision was made
      over the left knee, followed by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. The patella
      was everted, and extensive osteophytes were debrided. The distal femur and proximal
      tibia were resected using standard guides. Trial components were placed and
      satisfactory alignment and stability were confirmed. The definitive cemented
      components were implanted. Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was closed
      in layers. Sterile dressing was applied.
