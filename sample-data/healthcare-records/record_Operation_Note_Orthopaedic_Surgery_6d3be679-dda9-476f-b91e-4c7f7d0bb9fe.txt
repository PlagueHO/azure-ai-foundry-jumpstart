Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. John Spencer presented with severe left knee pain and limited mobility secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, unresponsive to conservative management including physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular steroid injections.

**History:**  
The patient has a 4-year history of progressive left knee pain, worsening over the past 12 months. Functional decline has significantly impacted activities of daily living. No prior surgical interventions on the affected knee. No history of inflammatory arthritis, infection, or trauma. Medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

**Assessment:**  
Diagnosis: End-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade IV).  
Indication: Failure of conservative management and significant impairment of function.

**Procedure Performed:**  
Left total knee arthroplasty using cemented components.

**Date of Surgery:**  
2025-05-17

**Anesthesia:**  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation.

**Findings:**  
Intraoperative examination confirmed severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis with extensive cartilage loss, osteophyte formation, and deformity of the femoral and tibial articular surfaces. No evidence of infection or ligamentous instability. Bone quality was adequate for prosthesis implantation.

**Operative Details:**  
- Standard midline skin incision and medial parapatellar arthrotomy performed.
- Osteophytes excised and joint surfaces prepared.
- Femoral and tibial cuts made according to preoperative templating.
- Cemented total knee prosthesis (FictionalOrtho Model 3000) implanted.
- Patella resurfaced with cemented polyethylene button.
- Alignment and stability confirmed through range of motion.
- Hemostasis achieved; wound closed in layers.
- Sterile dressing applied.

**Estimated Blood Loss:**  
250 mL

**Complications:**  
None encountered intraoperatively.

**Plan:**  
- Postoperative analgesia protocol initiated.
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy to begin on postoperative day 1.
- Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin for 14 days.
- Wound review in 2 weeks.
- Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic in 6 weeks for assessment of progress and radiographs.

**Recommendations:**  
- Continue physical therapy as directed.
- Monitor for signs of infection or thromboembolism.
- Gradual return to activities as tolerated.
