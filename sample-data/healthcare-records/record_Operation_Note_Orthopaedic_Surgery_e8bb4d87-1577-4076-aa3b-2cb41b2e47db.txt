Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note  

Date of Service: 2025-05-17  

Reason for Visit  
Mr. Smith presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, refractory to conservative management including physiotherapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular injections.

History  
Patient has a five-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. Radiographs demonstrated severe tricompartmental osteoarthritic changes with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. No prior history of knee surgery or infection. No known drug allergies.

Preoperative Assessment  
Physical examination revealed antalgic gait, left knee effusion, and limited range of motion (10-90 degrees). Preoperative labs and cardiac clearance were within normal limits.

Procedure  
Left total knee arthroplasty was performed under spinal anesthesia. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered preoperatively. A midline skin incision and medial parapatellar arthrotomy were utilized. Osteophytes were excised, and the distal femur and proximal tibia were prepared using standard instrumentation. Trial components were inserted and confirmed for alignment, stability, and range of motion. Cemented prosthetic components were implanted. Patella was resurfaced. Wound was irrigated and closed in layers. A sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was transferred to the recovery unit in stable condition.

Intraoperative Findings  
- Severe tricompartmental cartilage loss  
- Large osteophytes at the femoral condyles and tibial plateau  
- No evidence of infection or significant synovitis  
- Ligamentous structures intact  

Estimated Blood Loss: 350 mL  
No intraoperative complications.

Postoperative Plan  
- Monitor vital signs and neurovascular status of the left lower limb  
- Initiate DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin  
- Begin physiotherapy with continuous passive motion on postoperative day 1  
- Pain management per standard protocol  
- Wound care instructions provided  
- Plan for discharge on postoperative day 3 pending mobilization and pain control

Recommendations  
- Continue outpatient physiotherapy following discharge  
- Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic in 2 weeks for wound review and suture removal  
- Monitor for signs of infection or thromboembolic events  
- Avoid high-impact activities; gradual return to daily activities as tolerated
