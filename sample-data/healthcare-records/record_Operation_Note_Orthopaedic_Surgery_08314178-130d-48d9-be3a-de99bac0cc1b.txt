Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

Reason for Visit:  
Mr. Smith was admitted for surgical management of end-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee, refractory to conservative measures.

History:  
The patient has a 5-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. Conservative treatments, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, have failed to provide sustained relief. No prior knee surgeries. Medical history notable for controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Assessment:  
Diagnosis: Severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the left knee with functional limitation.

Preoperative Plan:  
- Proceed with elective left total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.  
- Preoperative labs and imaging reviewed and within acceptable limits.  
- Prophylactic antibiotics to be administered preoperatively.

Intraoperative Findings:  
- Procedure performed under spinal anesthesia with tourniquet control.  
- Standard medial parapatellar approach utilized.  
- Extensive degenerative changes noted in the femoral, tibial, and patellar compartments.  
- Osteophytes excised; joint surfaces prepared.  
- Cemented total knee prosthesis (fictional model: OrthoFlex Modular #7) implanted with appropriate alignment and fixation.  
- Patellar resurfacing performed.  
- Range of motion assessed intraoperatively: 0-110 degrees, stable to varus and valgus stress.  
- Hemostasis achieved; wound closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied.

Complications:  
None encountered intraoperatively.

Estimated Blood Loss:  
250 mL

Implants Used:  
- OrthoFlex Modular #7 femoral component  
- OrthoFlex Modular #7 tibial component  
- OrthoFlex Modular patellar button

Postoperative Plan:  
- Monitor vital signs and neurovascular status of the left lower limb.  
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy commencing on postoperative day 1.  
- Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.  
- Pain management per protocol.  
- Wound inspection in 48 hours.

Recommendations:  
- Continue standard postoperative rehabilitation protocol for total knee arthroplasty.  
- Outpatient follow-up in 2 weeks for suture removal and assessment.  
- Patient and family educated on signs of infection and deep vein thrombosis.
