Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology Service

Admission Date: 2025-05-12  
Discharge Date: 2025-05-19  

Reason for Admission:  
Ms. Porter was admitted with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. Initial evaluation indicated a suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Hospital Course:  
On admission, an ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads. Cardiac enzymes were elevated. The patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where angiography revealed a 95% occlusion of the right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement was performed successfully.

Ms. Porter was monitored in the cardiac care unit for 48 hours post-procedure. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), beta-blockers, statin, and ACE inhibitor. Her hospital course was uncomplicated, and she remained hemodynamically stable throughout. Echocardiogram performed on 2025-05-16 showed preserved left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55%.

During her stay, she was evaluated by the cardiac rehabilitation team and received counseling on lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation (although she is a lifelong non-smoker).

Discharge Medications:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  

Follow-Up Recommendations:  
- Outpatient cardiology follow-up in 2 weeks  
- Continue all prescribed medications  
- Begin cardiac rehabilitation program  
- Monitor for symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations and seek immediate medical attention if these occur

Prognosis:  
Ms. Porter is being discharged in stable condition. Prognosis is favorable given the prompt intervention and preserved cardiac function.
