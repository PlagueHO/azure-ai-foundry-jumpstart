Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Carter was admitted for evaluation and management of acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath.

Hospital Course:  
On admission, the patient presented with central chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with diaphoresis. Initial ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. Cardiac enzymes were elevated. The patient was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was promptly taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a 90% occlusion of the right coronary artery was identified and successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and drug-eluting stent placement.

During his stay, Mr. Carter was monitored in the coronary care unit. He received dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors. No significant arrhythmias or heart failure symptoms occurred post-procedure. His echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% with mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
