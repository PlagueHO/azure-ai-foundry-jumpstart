Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology Admission

Admission Date: 2025-05-15  
Discharge Date: 2025-05-19  

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Jordan Ellis was admitted for evaluation and management of acute chest pain and dyspnea, suspected to be of cardiac origin.

Hospital Course:  
On admission, the patient presented with substernal chest discomfort radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath. An ECG revealed ST segment elevations in the inferior leads. Initial troponin was elevated at 3.7 ng/mL. The patient was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab.

A coronary angiogram revealed a 95% occlusion of the right coronary artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed. The patient was monitored in the cardiac care unit for 48 hours, during which he remained hemodynamically stable, without evidence of arrhythmia or further ischemia.

Medications were optimized to include dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor. The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and education on lifestyle modification was provided.

Discharge Condition:  
The patient is stable and ambulatory at the time of discharge. No chest pain or shortness of breath. Vitals are within normal limits. Discharge ECG shows resolution of ST elevations.

Discharge Medications:  
1. Aspirin 81 mg daily  
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
3. Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
4. Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
5. Lisinopril 10 mg daily

- Avoid strenuous activity for 2 weeks.  
- Cardiac rehabilitation referral provided.  
- Follow up in Cardiology Clinic in 1 week.
