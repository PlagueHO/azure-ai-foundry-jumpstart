Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Caldwell was admitted on 2025-05-15 with complaints of acute chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with mild shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Initial evaluation in the emergency department indicated possible acute coronary syndrome.

Hospital Course:  
Upon admission, the patient underwent immediate cardiac monitoring and laboratory investigation. ECG revealed ST-segment depression in the lateral leads. Troponin I was elevated at 1.5 ng/mL. The patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, and low-molecular-weight heparin. He underwent a coronary angiogram on 2025-05-16, which revealed a 75% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery.

A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no peri-procedural complications. Subsequent monitoring showed normalization of cardiac enzymes and resolution of chest pain. Echocardiogram post-procedure revealed an ejection fraction of 53% with no wall motion abnormalities.

Medications at Discharge:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
