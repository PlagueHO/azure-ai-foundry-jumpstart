Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology  

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Whittaker was admitted to the cardiology unit on 2025-05-12 following complaints of acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. Initial evaluation in the emergency department suggested a possible acute coronary syndrome.

Hospital Course:  
Upon admission, the patient underwent ECG and cardiac enzyme testing, which confirmed a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and low molecular weight heparin. Cardiac catheterization performed on 2025-05-13 revealed significant stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was placed successfully, with no immediate complications.

Mr. Whittaker remained hemodynamically stable post-procedure. Serial troponins showed a downward trend, and his symptoms resolved. Cardiac rehabilitation and risk factor modification were initiated, including dietary counseling and a tailored exercise program.

Discharge Medications:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL as needed for chest pain  

Instructions and Follow-Up:  
Mr. Whittaker is advised to avoid strenuous activity for the next two weeks and to attend outpatient cardiac rehabilitation sessions. He should monitor for recurrent chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath and seek immediate care if these occur. Follow-up with his cardiologist is scheduled for 2025-05-26.

Prognosis:  
Prognosis is favorable with continued adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications.
