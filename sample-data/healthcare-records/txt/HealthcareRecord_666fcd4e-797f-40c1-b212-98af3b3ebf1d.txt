Title: Discharge Summary – Cardiology

Admission Date: 2025-05-13  
Discharge Date: 2025-05-19  

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Jordan Avery was admitted for evaluation and management of chest pain and shortness of breath that began two days prior to admission.

Hospital Course:  
On admission, the patient reported intermittent, pressure-like chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated with mild dyspnea. Initial ECG showed ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated. The patient was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, statins, and low-molecular-weight heparin.  

A coronary angiogram was performed on 2025-05-14, revealing a 90% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement. Post-procedure, he remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the cardiac step-down unit. No further chest pain or arrhythmias were noted. Echocardiogram demonstrated preserved left ventricular function (EF 55%).

Discharge Medications:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg daily  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  

Discharge Instructions:  
- Take all medications as prescribed.  
- Follow a heart-healthy, low-salt diet.  
- Restrict strenuous physical activity for 2 weeks.  
- Schedule follow-up appointment in Cardiology Clinic within 7 days.  
- Monitor for chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath and seek immediate medical attention if these occur.  
- Attend cardiac rehabilitation as referred.

Prognosis:  
With adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations, the patient’s prognosis is favorable. Continued outpatient follow-up is essential.
