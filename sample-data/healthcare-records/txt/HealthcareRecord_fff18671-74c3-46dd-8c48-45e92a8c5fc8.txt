Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology

Admission Date: 2025-05-13  
Discharge Date: 2025-05-19  

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Jordan Callister was admitted for evaluation and management of acute chest pain with associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis.

Hospital Course:  
Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient reported retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left arm, lasting for approximately 45 minutes. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. Troponin I was elevated at 3.2 ng/mL. The patient was diagnosed with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where coronary angiography revealed a 95% occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. Successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement was performed. Post-procedure, the patient was monitored in the coronary care unit and started on dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his stay. Repeat echocardiography on day 4 showed mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall, with preserved left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 52%).

Discharge Medications:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL as needed

Discharge Instructions:  
Mr. Callister is advised to follow a low-sodium, heart-healthy diet, avoid strenuous activity for 2 weeks, and monitor for any recurrence of chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. He should attend cardiac rehabilitation and follow up in the cardiology clinic in 1 week.

Prognosis:  
With adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications, prognosis is favorable. The patient is educated on recognizing warning signs of cardiac events and the importance of medication compliance.
