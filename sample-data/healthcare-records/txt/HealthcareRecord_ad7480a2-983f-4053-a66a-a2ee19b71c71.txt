Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology

Reason for Admission:  
Ms. Morgan R. Dales was admitted on 2025-05-14 with complaints of acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. The initial assessment suggested a possible acute coronary syndrome.

Hospital Course:  
The patient was evaluated promptly in the Emergency Department. Initial ECG revealed ST segment depressions in the anterolateral leads. Serial troponin levels were elevated, consistent with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Ms. Dales was admitted to the cardiac care unit for monitoring and management.

During her stay, she was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, and low molecular weight heparin. An echocardiogram demonstrated mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45%). Coronary angiography performed on 2025-05-16 showed a 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed without complications.

Ms. Dales remained hemodynamically stable post-procedure. She participated in early cardiac rehabilitation and was educated on lifestyle modifications and medication adherence. No further episodes of chest pain were reported during her hospitalization.

Discharge Medications:  
1. Aspirin 81 mg daily  
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
3. Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
4. Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
5. Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
6. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL as needed for chest pain

Discharge Instructions:  
- Continue all prescribed medications as directed  
- Follow a heart-healthy, low-sodium diet  
- Restrict strenuous activity for at least 2 weeks; gradually increase as tolerated  
- Attend outpatient cardiac rehabilitation as scheduled  
- Monitor for symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or syncope; seek immediate medical attention if these occur  
- Schedule follow-up with cardiology clinic in 1 week

Follow-up Plan:  
Ms. Dales is to return for a cardiology outpatient visit on 2025-05-26. Laboratory work and repeat echocardiogram will be performed at that time.

Prognosis:  
With adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications, prognosis is favorable. Risk factor modification is essential to reduce future cardiovascular events.
