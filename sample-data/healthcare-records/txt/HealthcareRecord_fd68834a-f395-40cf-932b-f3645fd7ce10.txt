Acute Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)

2. Hospital Course:  
Mr. Lucas Harmon was admitted on 2025-05-13 with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with mild shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Initial ECG revealed non-specific ST-T changes, and troponin levels were elevated. The patient was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, and anticoagulation. Cardiology was consulted, and a coronary angiogram was performed on 2025-05-14, revealing 80% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed.

3. Hospital Course and Treatment:  
During hospitalization, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. No arrhythmias were noted on continuous telemetry monitoring. Serial cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately. He was mobilized on day 2 post-procedure and tolerated ambulation without symptoms. The patient participated in cardiac rehabilitation education and was counseled extensively regarding lifestyle modification.

4. Discharge Medications:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL as needed for chest pain

5. Discharge Instructions:  
The patient is advised to adhere strictly to medication regimen and follow a low-sodium, heart-healthy diet. Smoking cessation and regular physical activity are recommended. He should monitor for chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or syncope and seek immediate care if these occur. Follow-up with his cardiologist is scheduled for 2025-05-26.

6. Prognosis:
