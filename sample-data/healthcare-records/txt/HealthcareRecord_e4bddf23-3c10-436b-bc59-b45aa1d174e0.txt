Title: Discharge Summary â€“ Cardiology Admission

Admission Date: 2025-05-12  
Discharge Date: 2025-05-19  

Reason for Admission:  
Mr. Ellery was admitted with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial workup suggested a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Hospital Course:  
The patient was evaluated by the cardiology team and underwent serial cardiac enzyme testing and ECGs, confirming NSTEMI. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, and low molecular weight heparin. Coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis in the right coronary artery, for which he underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting.

The patient's post-procedural course was uneventful. He remained hemodynamically stable, and no arrhythmias were observed. Cardiac rehabilitation and risk factor modification were initiated during his stay.

Investigations:  
- ECG: Non-specific ST-segment changes  
- Troponin I: Elevated at 2.7 ng/mL  
- Echocardiogram: Mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (45%)  
- Coronary Angiogram: 80% stenosis of RCA, successfully stented

Medications on Discharge:  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily  
- Ramipril 5 mg daily  
- Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed

Discharge Instructions:  
- Follow a heart-healthy diet and limit salt intake  
- Attend cardiac rehabilitation as scheduled  
- Take all medications as prescribed  
- Monitor for chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations and seek immediate care if these occur  
- Follow-up appointment with cardiology in 1 week

Prognosis:  
Mr. Ellery is stable at discharge with good functional status. Prognosis is favorable with adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications.
