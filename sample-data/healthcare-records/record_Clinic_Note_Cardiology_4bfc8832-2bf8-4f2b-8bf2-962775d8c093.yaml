  title: Cardiology Clinic Follow-up Note
  sections:
  - heading: Reason for Visit/Consultation
    content: Ms. Jane Doe presents for a routine cardiology follow-up to monitor her
      hypertension and evaluate her recent symptoms of mild shortness of breath.
  - heading: History of Present Illness
    content: The patient reports experiencing occasional shortness of breath over
      the past two weeks, particularly when climbing stairs. She denies chest pain,
      palpitations, syncope, or lower extremity swelling. She has been compliant with
      her medications and has not noticed any significant changes in her overall health.
  - heading: Past Medical History
    content: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. No history of coronary
      artery disease, diabetes, or stroke.
  - heading: Assessment
    content: Ms. Doe is a 58-year-old woman with well-controlled hypertension and
      hyperlipidemia. Her mild exertional dyspnea is likely multifactorial but does
      not currently suggest acute cardiac pathology. No evidence of heart failure
      or arrhythmia at this time.
  - heading: Plan
    content: Continue current antihypertensive and statin therapy. Encourage regular
      physical activity and dietary modifications. Schedule echocardiogram to further
      evaluate cardiac function. Return to clinic in 3 months or sooner if symptoms
      worsen.
