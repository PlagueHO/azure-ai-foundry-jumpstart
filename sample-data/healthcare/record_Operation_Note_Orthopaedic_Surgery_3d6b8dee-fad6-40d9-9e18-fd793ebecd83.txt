Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. John Smith presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis. Conservative management, including physical therapy and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, failed to provide adequate symptom relief.

**History:**  
- Past Medical History: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia  
- Past Surgical History: Appendectomy (1988)  
- Allergies: No known drug allergies  
- Medications: Lisinopril, Atorvastatin  
- Social History: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use

**Assessment:**  
Severe left knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade IV) with significant impact on mobility and quality of life. Radiographs confirm joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis.

**Preoperative Plan:**  
- Proceed with left total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia  
- Preoperative antibiotics (cefazolin 2g IV)  
- DVT prophylaxis as per protocol

**Procedure Details:**  
Date: 2025-05-17  
Time: 08:15â€“10:05  
Surgeon: Dr. Samuel Carter  
Assistant: Dr. Priya Patel  
Anesthesia: Spinal

**Findings:**  
- Marked degenerative changes of the femoral and tibial articular surfaces  
- Extensive osteophyte formation  
- Intact cruciate and collateral ligaments  
- No evidence of infection or loose bodies

**Surgical Procedure:**  
1. Patient positioned supine with left lower extremity prepped and draped sterilely.  
2. Standard midline skin incision and medial parapatellar arthrotomy performed.  
3. Significant osteophytes excised; distal femur and proximal tibia cut using intramedullary and extramedullary guides, respectively.  
4. Trial components inserted, confirming satisfactory alignment and stability.  
5. Final cemented components implanted (size 5 femoral, size 4 tibial, 10mm polyethylene insert).  
6. Patella resurfaced and tracking confirmed.  
7. Wound irrigated, hemostasis achieved, and layers closed in standard fashion.  
8. Sterile dressing applied; knee immobilizer placed.

**Estimated Blood Loss:** 350 mL  
**Specimens Sent:** None  
**Complications:** None

**Postoperative Plan:**  
- Monitor neurovascular status of left lower limb  
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy starting postoperative day 1  
- Analgesia regimen as per protocol  
- Continue DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40mg SC daily)  
- Wound check in 48 hours  
- Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic in 2 weeks

**Recommendations:**  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with walker  
- Continue home exercises as instructed by physiotherapy  
- Return to clinic for suture removal and further evaluation  
- Signs of infection, DVT, or wound complications to be reported immediately
