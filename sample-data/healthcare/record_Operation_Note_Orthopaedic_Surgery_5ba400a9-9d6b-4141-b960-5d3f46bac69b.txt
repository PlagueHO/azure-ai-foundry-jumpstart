Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. Turner presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, unresponsive to conservative management.

**History:**  
The patient has a 4-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Non-surgical treatments, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, provided only temporary relief. No history of previous knee surgeries. Medical history includes hypertension and type II diabetes, both well controlled.

**Assessment:**  
Diagnosis: End-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee with significant impact on daily activities and quality of life.

**Preoperative Plan:**  
- Procedure: Left total knee arthroplasty  
- Prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively  
- Standard DVT prophylaxis planned postoperatively  
- Blood products on standby

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
- Date of Surgery: 2025-05-17  
- Anesthesia: Spinal anesthesia with sedation  
- Position: Supine  
- Approach: Medial parapatellar  
- Intraoperative findings revealed severe tricompartmental cartilage loss, osteophyte formation, and varus deformity. No evidence of infection or ligamentous instability.  
- Femoral and tibial cuts made using standard jigs. Cemented prosthesis inserted without complication. Patella resurfaced due to significant chondral wear.

**Procedure Details:**  
- Tourniquet time: 68 minutes  
- Estimated blood loss: 350 mL  
- No intraoperative complications  
- Wound closed in layers; sterile dressing applied

**Immediate Postoperative Plan:**  
- Pain control with multimodal analgesia  
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy  
- Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin  
- Monitor wound for signs of infection  
- Routine radiographs to confirm prosthesis position

**Recommendations:**  
- Continue postoperative physiotherapy to maximize range of motion and strength  
- Follow-up in 2 weeks for wound check and suture removal  
- Monitor for signs of infection, DVT, or prosthetic complications  
- Resume regular medications as per medical team guidance
