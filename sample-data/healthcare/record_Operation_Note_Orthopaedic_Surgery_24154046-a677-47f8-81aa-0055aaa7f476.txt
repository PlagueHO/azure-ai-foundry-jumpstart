Title: Left Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction  

**Reason for Visit**  
Patient presented with left knee instability and pain following a soccer injury sustained three weeks prior to admission. MRI confirmed a complete tear of the left anterior cruciate ligament. Conservative management failed to relieve symptoms, and surgical reconstruction was indicated.  

**History**  
- History of present illness: Patient reports sudden onset of left knee pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight after a twisting injury during a soccer match.  
- Past medical history: No significant comorbidities. No prior surgeries.  
- Medications: Occasional ibuprofen for pain.  
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.  

**Assessment**  
- Diagnosis: Complete rupture of the left anterior cruciate ligament.  
- Associated findings: Mild joint effusion, negative for fractures.  

**Procedure**  
- Date: 2025-05-17  
- Procedure Performed: Arthroscopically assisted left ACL reconstruction using hamstring autograft.  
- Anesthesia: General  
- Position: Supine with left leg in leg holder  

**Intraoperative Findings**  
- Complete ACL rupture visualized arthroscopically  
- Mild synovitis noted  
- Medial and lateral menisci intact  
- No chondral lesions identified  

**Operative Details**  
- Standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals established  
- Remnants of torn ACL debrided  
- Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons harvested and prepared as quadruple-strand graft  
- Tibial and femoral tunnels drilled under direct visualization  
- Graft passed and fixed with interference screws on both tibial and femoral sides  
- Full range of motion confirmed intraoperatively  
- No complications encountered  

**Estimated Blood Loss**  
- <50 mL  

**Specimens**  
- None sent  

**Implants**  
- Bioabsorbable interference screws (femoral and tibial)  

**Postoperative Plan**  
- Knee immobilizer applied  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches  
- Ice and elevation for swelling  
- Analgesia: Acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed  
- Physical therapy to start post-op day 1, focusing on gentle range of motion and quadriceps activation  
- Follow-up appointment in 10 days for wound check and suture removal  

**Recommendations**  
- Monitor for signs of infection (fever, redness, increased pain)  
- Continue home exercises as instructed by physical therapist  
- Avoid high-impact activities until cleared by surgeon
