Patient ID: FAKE-PT-1024  

--- Document: Operation Note ---  
Title: Left Knee Arthroscopic Partial Medial Meniscectomy

Reason for Visit  
Mr. Carter presented with persistent left knee pain and mechanical symptoms (locking and catching) following a soccer injury four months prior. Conservative management, including physical therapy and NSAIDs, failed to provide adequate relief.

History  
The patient reported an acute twisting injury to the left knee while playing soccer. MRI demonstrated a complex tear of the medial meniscus. No prior history of knee surgery or significant comorbidities.

Preoperative Assessment  
Physical examination revealed joint line tenderness and positive McMurray’s test. Range of motion was mildly limited by pain. No signs of ligamentous instability. Preoperative labs were within normal limits.

Procedure  
Date: 2025-05-17  
Surgeon: Dr. Evelyn Harper  
Assistants: Dr. David Lin, OR Nurse Sarah Green  
Anesthesia: General

Findings  
Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a complex, degenerative tear of the posterior horn and body of the medial meniscus. Articular cartilage was intact except for mild chondromalacia on the medial femoral condyle. No evidence of ligament injury.

Intervention  
A partial medial meniscectomy was performed, excising the unstable meniscal fragments and contouring the remaining tissue to a stable rim. The joint was irrigated thoroughly. No complications occurred.

Estimated Blood Loss: Minimal (<10 mL)  
Specimens: Meniscal tissue (sent to pathology)  
Implants: None

Postoperative Plan  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches for 2–3 days  
- Ice and elevation for swelling  
- Analgesia: Acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed  
- Begin physical therapy in 1 week, focusing on range of motion and strengthening  
- Follow-up appointment in 10 days for wound check and suture removal  

Recommendations  
Patient advised to avoid high-impact activities for 4–6 weeks. Signs of infection, increased pain, or swelling to be reported immediately. Prognosis for return to full activity is good with compliance to rehabilitation.
