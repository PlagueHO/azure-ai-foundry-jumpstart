  title: Cardiology Clinic Follow-up Note
  sections:
  - heading: Reason for Visit/Consultation
    content: Ms. Samantha Carter presents for a routine follow-up evaluation of her
      hypertension and recently diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
  - heading: History of Present Illness
    content: The patient reports intermittent episodes of palpitations over the past
      two weeks, typically lasting a few minutes and resolving spontaneously. She
      denies chest pain, syncope, or shortness of breath. Blood pressure readings
      at home have been generally well controlled, averaging around 128/82 mmHg. She
      notes mild fatigue but attributes this to her work schedule. No recent hospitalizations.
  - heading: Past Medical History
    content: Hypertension, diagnosed 8 years ago; hyperlipidemia; paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (diagnosed 1 month ago); hypothyroidism. No history of diabetes
      or coronary artery disease.
  - heading: Assessment
    content: Stable hypertension, well controlled on current medications. Paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation with low burden of symptoms and no evidence of hemodynamic
      compromise. No signs of heart failure or ischemia. Risk factors for thromboembolism
      present.
  - heading: Plan
    content: Continue current antihypertensive (lisinopril 20 mg daily) and statin
      therapy. Reinforce adherence to apixaban 5 mg BID for stroke prevention. Monitor
      symptoms and consider ambulatory cardiac monitoring if episodes increase. Schedule
      echocardiogram to assess left atrial size and ventricular function. Follow up
      in three months or sooner if symptoms worsen.
