--- Document: Operation Note ---  
Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty  

Reason for Visit  
Mr. John Smith presented with severe left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis. Conservative management including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular injections failed to provide adequate relief.  

History  
Patient has a 3-year history of progressive left knee pain, worsened by activity and weight-bearing. No history of trauma. No previous surgeries on the affected limb. Medical history includes controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  

Preoperative Assessment  
Physical examination revealed marked varus deformity, reduced range of motion (10-75 degrees), and crepitus. Imaging (X-ray) confirmed tricompartmental osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. Laboratory work-up within normal limits.  

Procedure Performed  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.  

Findings  
Intraoperatively, significant articular cartilage loss was noted in all compartments. Large osteophytes were present medially and posteriorly. No evidence of infection or previous hardware.  

Operative Details  
- Standard medial parapatellar approach used.  
- Osteophytes excised, and soft tissue releases performed to correct varus alignment.  
- Femoral and tibial cuts made using intramedullary and extramedullary guides, respectively.  
- Trial components inserted with good stability and alignment.  
- Cemented prosthesis (FictaKnee System, size 5 femur, 4 tibia, 10mm insert) implanted.  
- Patella resurfaced.  
- Meticulous hemostasis achieved.  
- Wound closed in layers; sterile dressing applied.  

Estimated Blood Loss: 300 mL  
Drains: 1 Hemovac drain placed  
Complications: None  

Postoperative Plan  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with walker assistance  
- Start physiotherapy on postoperative day 1  
- Prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT prevention  
- Analgesia as needed  
- Monitor wound and drain output  
- Anticipated discharge in 3-4 days  

Recommendations  
Continue routine post-arthroplasty care. Follow-up in outpatient clinic at 2 weeks for wound review and suture removal. Advise on home exercise program and signs of infection or thromboembolism.
