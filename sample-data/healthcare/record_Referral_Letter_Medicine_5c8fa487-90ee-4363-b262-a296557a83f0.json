        "content": "On examination, vital signs are stable. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Recent ECG in clinic showed occasional premature atrial contractions but was otherwise unremarkable. Baseline laboratory studies, including lipid profile and thyroid function, are within normal limits."

        "heading": "Plan",
        "content": "Given the persistence of her symptoms, I recommend further evaluation by cardiology for possible ambulatory monitoring and echocardiogram. Please assess for underlying arrhythmia or structural heart disease and advise on management. The patient has been counseled on lifestyle modifications and to avoid caffeine and other stimulants. She will follow up with your clinic as soon as an appointment is available."
