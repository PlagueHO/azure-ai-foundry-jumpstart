Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. Carter presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, refractory to conservative management.

**History:**  
The patient has a 3-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. Non-surgical treatments including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections provided minimal and short-term relief. Radiographs demonstrated severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis with significant joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation.

**Assessment:**  
End-stage left knee osteoarthritis, not responsive to conservative measures.

**Procedure Performed:**  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Date of Surgery:**  
2025-05-17

**Surgeon:**  
Dr. Alex Monroe

**Assistants:**  
Dr. Priya Singh, OR Nurse Jamie Lin

**Anesthesia:**  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation

**Findings:**  
- Severe degenerative changes in all compartments of the left knee
- Intact collateral ligaments
- No evidence of infection or gross deformity beyond preoperative assessment

**Operative Details:**  
The patient was placed supine on the operating table. After appropriate anesthesia was administered, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline longitudinal incision was made over the left knee, followed by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. Extensive osteophytes were removed, and the distal femur and proximal tibia were prepared using standard cutting guides. Trial components were inserted, confirming appropriate alignment, stability, and range of motion. Final cemented components were implanted. The patella was resurfaced. Wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. No intraoperative complications.

**Estimated Blood Loss:**  
250 mL

**Implants Used:**  
Fictional OrthoKnee System, Size 5 femoral, Size 4 tibial, 10 mm polyethylene insert

**Plan:**  
- Postoperative pain control with multimodal analgesia
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy starting postoperative day 1
- DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin
- Routine wound care and monitoring for signs of infection

**Recommendations:**  
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with walker
- Continue inpatient physiotherapy
- Outpatient follow-up in 2 weeks for suture removal and wound check
- Continue DVT prophylaxis for 4 weeks postoperatively
- Contact clinic if fever, excessive swelling, or drainage occurs
