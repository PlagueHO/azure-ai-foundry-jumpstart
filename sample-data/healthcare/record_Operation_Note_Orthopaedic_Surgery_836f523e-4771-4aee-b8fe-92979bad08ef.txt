Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. Carter presented with chronic left knee pain and functional limitation secondary to advanced osteoarthritis, unresponsive to conservative management including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections.

**History:**  
The patient reports a 5-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. Radiographs revealed tricompartmental osteoarthritis with significant joint space narrowing. No prior surgical interventions on the left knee. Past medical history notable for controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

**Preoperative Assessment:**  
Physical examination revealed antalgic gait, varus deformity, and reduced range of motion (10â€“85 degrees). No signs of active infection. Preoperative labs and anesthetic evaluation were within normal limits.

**Procedure Performed:**  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Date of Surgery:**  
2025-05-17

**Surgeon:**  
Dr. Evelyn Brooks, MD

**Anesthesia:**  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation

**Operative Findings:**  
Significant degenerative changes observed, including complete loss of articular cartilage in the medial and patellofemoral compartments. Subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation noted. No evidence of intra-articular loose bodies or ligamentous instability.

**Operative Details:**  
A midline incision was made over the left knee, and a standard medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. The femoral and tibial surfaces were prepared using intramedullary and extramedullary guides, respectively. Trial components were inserted and satisfactory alignment, stability, and range of motion were confirmed. Cemented total knee prosthesis (fictional brand: OrthoFlex Ultra) was implanted. Patella was resurfaced. Hemostasis achieved, wound irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied.

**Estimated Blood Loss:**  
300 mL

**Complications:**  
None encountered intraoperatively.

**Postoperative Plan:**  
- Monitor neurovascular status of the left lower limb  
- Early mobilization with physiotherapy starting postoperative day 1  
- Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin  
- Pain management as per protocol  
- Wound check in 48 hours

**Recommendations:**  
Patient to follow up in orthopaedic clinic in 2 weeks for suture removal and assessment. Continue physical therapy for range of motion and strengthening. Monitor for signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, or prosthesis-related complications.
