Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit**  
Mr. Turner presented with chronic left knee pain secondary to severe osteoarthritis, resulting in significant functional limitation and failure of conservative management.

**History**  
The patient has a 5-year history of progressive left knee pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. Non-operative measures including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular steroid injections provided minimal relief. No prior surgeries on the left knee. No history of infection or trauma.

**Preoperative Assessment**  
Physical examination revealed marked crepitus, reduced range of motion (10-90 degrees), and varus deformity. Radiographs demonstrated tricompartmental osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. No evidence of infection or fracture.

**Procedure Performed**  
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Date of Surgery**  
2025-05-17

**Surgeon**  
Dr. Evelyn Harper

**Anesthesia**  
Spinal anesthesia with sedation

**Operative Findings**  
- Severe degenerative changes in all compartments of the left knee  
- Intact collateral ligaments and extensor mechanism  
- No intra-articular loose bodies  
- No evidence of infection

**Procedure Details**  
After proper identification and site marking, the patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine. A standard midline incision was made and a medial parapatellar arthrotomy performed. Extensive osteophytes were excised. The distal femur and proximal tibia were prepared using appropriate guides. Trial components were inserted and stable alignment confirmed. Cemented prosthetic components (femoral, tibial, and patellar) were implanted. Hemostasis was achieved. The wound was irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. Patient tolerated the procedure well.

**Estimated Blood Loss**  
250 mL

**Specimens**  
None

**Complications**  
None encountered intraoperatively.

**Postoperative Plan**  
- Monitor in recovery room  
- Begin physical therapy on postoperative day 1  
- DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin  
- Analgesia as per protocol  
- Wound care instructions provided  
- Follow-up in 2 weeks for suture removal and evaluation

**Recommendations**  
Continue postoperative rehabilitation program. Monitor for signs of infection, DVT, and neurovascular compromise. Gradually advance weight-bearing as tolerated.
