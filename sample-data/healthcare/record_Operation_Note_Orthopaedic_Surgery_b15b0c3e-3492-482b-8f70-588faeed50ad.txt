Title: Left Total Knee Arthroplasty Operation Note

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. Turner presented with a longstanding history of left knee pain secondary to advanced osteoarthritis. Conservative management, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, failed to provide adequate relief. The patient was scheduled for elective left total knee arthroplasty.

**History:**  
- History of progressive left knee pain and stiffness for over 5 years  
- Difficulty ambulating, requiring use of a cane for the past 6 months  
- Failed nonoperative management  
- No prior surgeries on the left knee  
- No known drug allergies  
- Past medical history: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia  

**Assessment:**  
- End-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade IV)  
- Functional limitation and impaired quality of life  

**Preoperative Plan:**  
- Left total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia  
- Use of cemented prosthesis  
- Prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively  
- Thromboprophylaxis postoperatively  

**Operative Findings:**  
- Severe tricompartmental cartilage loss  
- Osteophyte formation along femoral condyles and tibial plateau  
- No evidence of infection or gross instability  
- Medial meniscus severely degenerated  

**Procedure Details:**  
- Patient positioned supine; left lower extremity prepped and draped in sterile fashion  
- Standard medial parapatellar approach utilized  
- Osteophytes excised; distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts made  
- Trial components inserted with satisfactory alignment and stability  
- Cemented prosthesis implanted; patella resurfaced  
- Wound irrigated and closed in layers  
- Sterile dressing applied; knee immobilizer placed  

**Intraoperative Complications:**  
- None observed  

**Estimated Blood Loss:**  
- 250 mL  

**Postoperative Plan & Recommendations:**  
- Begin physical therapy on postoperative day 1  
- DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin for 2 weeks  
- Oral analgesics as needed  
- Wound check in 2 weeks  
- Follow-up in orthopaedic clinic in 6 weeks  
- Signs of infection, DVT, or other complications to be monitored
