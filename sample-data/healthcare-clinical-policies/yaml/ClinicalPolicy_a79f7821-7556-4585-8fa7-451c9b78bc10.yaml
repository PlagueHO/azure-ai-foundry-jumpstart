purpose: To provide evidence-based guidance for infection control in Pediatrics practice
  to ensure optimal patient outcomes and standardized care delivery.
scope:
  patient_populations:
  - Adult patients presenting with pediatrics conditions
  - Patients requiring infection control intervention
  clinical_settings:
  - Emergency Department
  - Inpatient Ward
  - Outpatient Clinic
  exclusion_criteria:
  - Pediatric patients under 18 years
  - Patients with multiple comorbidities requiring specialized care
background:
  clinical_rationale: Current evidence supports standardized approaches to infection
    control in Pediatrics to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes.
  epidemiology: Approximately 34% of pediatrics cases require this type of intervention
    annually.
  current_evidence_summary: Multiple Level II studies demonstrate efficacy of standardized
    protocols in reducing adverse events and improving patient satisfaction.
