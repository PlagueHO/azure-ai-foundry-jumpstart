  Multiple customers are reporting that they're getting stuck on the checkout screen. The payment just keeps spinning and eventually errors out. We've had several complaints in the last hour.

  Thank you for reporting this, Elaine. Can you confirm if there are any specific error messages or codes appearing for customers, or is it just a generic timeout? Also, are all payment methods affected or just certain ones?

  It seems to be all payment methods. Most users just see "Payment could not be processed, please try again later." Our logs show some 504 Gateway Timeout errors from the /api/checkout endpoint.

  Understood. We’re looking into potential API or back-end issues. Can you provide a recent order ID where this occurred? Also, have there been any recent deployments or config changes?

  Order ID: 1209841 failed at 05:28 UTC. No recent deployments or config changes on our end since last week.

  Thank you. We are seeing a spike in Service Bus queue depth—looks like messages from the checkout API are not being processed. We will escalate to the back-end team for immediate investigation.

  Update: The transaction processor listening to the Service Bus queue was in a failed state due to a connection string rotation earlier this morning. We are working to restore service and will update as soon as possible.

  The Service Bus connection string has been updated and the transaction processor is running again. Orders are now processing successfully. Please monitor and confirm on your end.

  Confirmed—checkout is working and orders are being processed again. Thanks for the quick response.

Resolved At: 2025-05-18T07:05:44.900120+00:00  
Resolution: Restored Service Bus connection string for the transaction processor, resolving the payment and order processing failures.  
Area: backend  
Is Bug: true  
Root Cause: Service Bus connection string used by the transaction processor was rotated but not updated in the application, causing a backlog and timeouts at checkout.
