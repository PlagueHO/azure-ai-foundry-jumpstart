- (2025-05-06T06:15:23+00:00) [customer] Hi, I've noticed that sometimes the inventory display on the dashboard has overlapping text or misplaced icons. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's a bit annoying.  
- (2025-05-06T06:20:42+00:00) [agent] Hi Joan, thank you for bringing this to our attention. Could you confirm if this happens on a specific browser or device? Also, are there any particular steps that trigger this behavior?  
- (2025-05-06T06:25:18+00:00) [customer] I use Chrome on Windows 11. It seems to happen randomly, but I noticed it more when switching between tabs quickly in the dashboard.  
- (2025-05-06T06:32:10+00:00) [agent] Thanks for the details. We'll investigate further. In the meantime, could you try clearing your browser cache or checking if Chrome is up-to-date?
