- 2025-05-18T05:38:06Z [customer] We’re getting reports from customers that nobody can place an order — after submitting payment, they see a generic “Payment failed. Please try again later.” message. We’ve tested with multiple cards and accounts, same issue. Nothing’s showing up in the Orders table in SQL.
- 2025-05-18T05:41:13Z [agent] Hi James, thank you for reporting this. To help diagnose the issue, can you confirm if you’re seeing any errors in the Application Insights logs for the API or if there are any dead-letter messages in the Service Bus? Also, has anything changed in your payment provider configuration or recent deployments?
