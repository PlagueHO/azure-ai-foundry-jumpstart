- 2025-05-18T05:35:42Z [customer] We're getting a "Payment processing error. Please try again later." message when trying to check out. This is happening for multiple users since last night. Any idea what's going on?
- 2025-05-18T05:37:11Z [agent] Thank you for reporting this, Olivia. To help us investigate, could you please confirm if this is affecting all payment methods or just specific ones (e.g. credit card, PayPal)? Are there any errors in the browser console or API responses you can share?
- 2025-05-18T06:01:03Z [customer] It's affecting all payment methods. In the console, I see a 500 error from /api/payments/process. The error message is just "Internal Server Error".
- 2025-05-18T06:08:47Z [agent] Thanks for the details. We're escalating this to our backend team. We will update you as soon as we have more information.
- 2025-05-18T08:21:29Z [agent] Update: Our backend team found a recent deployment changed the payment processor config, causing failures in connecting to the payment gateway. We're rolling back the config now.
- 2025-05-18T08:54:02Z [agent] Hi Olivia, the configuration has been rolled back and payment processing is working again. Can you please try to complete a checkout and confirm?
- 2025-05-18T09:04:10Z [customer] Just tested - checkout is working again! Thanks for the quick fix.
