Hi, I'm trying to access the "Sales Reports" section of the dashboard, but I'm getting an error that says "Something went wrong, please try again later."

Hello John, thanks for reaching out. I’m sorry to hear about the issue. Can you confirm if you’re seeing this error across multiple browsers or just one? Also, have you tried clearing your browser cache?

I’ve tried it on both Chrome and Edge, and the error is the same. I also cleared my cache, but it didn’t help.

Thanks for confirming, John. This might be related to a recent update we rolled out on the frontend. Let me investigate further and get back to you shortly.

Hi John, I’ve identified the issue—it seems to be caused by a bug in the frontend code that was introduced in the latest release. The development team has already deployed a hotfix, and you should now be able to access the "Sales Reports" section without any issues. Can you please try again and confirm?
