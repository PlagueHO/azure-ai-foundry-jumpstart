**Conversation History:**  
- **2025-05-06T06:15:22+00:00** [customer] "Hi, we’re seeing an error message on the checkout page when trying to apply a discount code. It says 'Invalid code' even though the code is valid and active in the system."  
- **2025-05-06T06:25:47+00:00** [agent] "Thanks for reporting this, Jane. I’ll investigate the issue and get back to you shortly. Could you confirm the discount code you were using?"  
- **2025-05-06T06:28:14+00:00** [customer] "Sure, the code is SPRING20. It should give 20% off."  
- **2025-05-06T06:40:59+00:00** [agent] "Thanks, Jane. I’ve checked, and it seems the discount code SPRING20 is configured correctly in the backend. Let me perform some additional tests on the frontend to see why the error is appearing."  
- **2025-05-06T07:15:34+00:00** [agent] "Hi again, Jane. The issue appears to be caused by a bug in the frontend validation logic for discount codes. I’ve escalated this to our development team for a fix. In the meantime, you can process the discount manually by adjusting the cart total during checkout."  
- **2025-05-06T07:22:11+00:00** [customer] "Got it, thanks for the update. I’ll let my team know to adjust manually while we wait for the fix."  
- **2025-05-07T09:45:00+00:00** [agent] "Hi Jane, I wanted to let you know that the bug has been resolved. The SPRING20 discount code should now work correctly on the checkout page. Please verify and let us know if you encounter any further issues."  
- **2025-05-07T10:02:35+00:00** [customer] "Thanks! I just tested it and can confirm it’s working fine now."
