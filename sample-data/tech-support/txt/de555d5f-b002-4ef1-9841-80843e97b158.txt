- (2025-05-06T06:15:00.000000+00:00) [customer] Hi, we're experiencing an issue where transactions fail during checkout. Customers can't complete purchases, and this is impacting our business.  
- (2025-05-06T06:20:00.000000+00:00) [agent] Hi John, thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the checkout issue. Can you confirm if this is happening for all transactions or only specific ones?  
- (2025-05-06T06:25:00.000000+00:00) [customer] It's happening for all transactions. When customers try to complete the payment, they get an error message saying "Transaction Failed: Unexpected Error."  
- (2025-05-06T06:30:00.000000+00:00) [agent] Thanks for confirming. We'll investigate this issue immediately. Can you provide any recent examples of error logs or timestamps for failed transactions?  
- (2025-05-06T06:40:00.000000+00:00) [customer] Sure, here's one: May 6th, 6:05 AM UTC, transaction ID 123456. I can send more if needed.  
- (2025-05-06T06:50:00.000000+00:00) [agent] Got it, thank you. I'll check the backend logs and escalate this to our engineering team for further analysis. I'll update you shortly.  

Resolved At: 2025-05-06T10:30:00.000000+00:00  
Resolution: The issue was caused by a recent update to the backend API that introduced a bug in the payment processing flow. The engineering team deployed a hotfix to correct the error and validated that transactions now complete successfully.  

Area: backend  
Is Bug: true  
Root Cause: A code change in the backend payment processing API inadvertently caused payment requests to timeout, resulting in failed transactions.
