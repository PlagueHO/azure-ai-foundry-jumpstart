**Conversation History:**  
- 2025-05-06T06:10:03+00:00 [customer] "Our entire checkout system is failing. None of our customers are able to complete transactions. This is urgent!"  
- 2025-05-06T06:12:15+00:00 [agent] "Thank you for reaching out, John. We understand the urgency. Can you confirm if there are any error messages appearing on the checkout screen?"  
- 2025-05-06T06:13:45+00:00 [customer] "Yes, there’s an error that says 'Unable to process request. Please try again later.' This happens for every transaction."  
- 2025-05-06T06:15:30+00:00 [agent] "Got it. I’ll escalate this immediately and start investigating. Can you confirm if this issue is affecting only one store or multiple locations?"  
- 2025-05-06T06:16:42+00:00 [customer] "It’s affecting all our locations, so it seems like a system-wide issue."  
- 2025-05-06T06:18:20+00:00 [agent] "Thank you for confirming. I see from our logs that there’s an unusually high number of failed API calls to the payment processing endpoint. I’ll loop in the backend team for deeper analysis."  
- 2025-05-06T06:45:10+00:00 [agent] "The root cause has been identified: a bug in the backend API deployment from earlier this morning caused payment requests to fail. A rollback is in progress."  
- 2025-05-06T07:05:33+00:00 [agent] "The rollback has been successfully completed. Can you test the checkout system now?"  
- 2025-05-06T07:07:12+00:00 [customer] "It’s working now! Transactions are processing correctly. Thank you for resolving this quickly."  
- 2025-05-06T07:08:45+00:00 [agent] "Glad to hear that everything is back to normal. Please let us know if you encounter any further issues."
