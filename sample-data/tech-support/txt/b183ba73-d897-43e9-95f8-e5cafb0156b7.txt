### Conversation History:  
- **2025-05-06T07:12:10+00:00 [customer]:** Hi, I noticed that some product images in the inventory section are not displaying correctly. They appear stretched or cropped in strange ways. Could you help me resolve this?  
- **2025-05-06T07:18:45+00:00 [agent]:** Hi Sarah, thanks for reporting this issue! Just to confirm, are all product images affected, or only specific ones? Also, could you let us know which browser you're using?  
- **2025-05-06T07:22:33+00:00 [customer]:** It seems to be only specific images, not all of them. I'm using Google Chrome on Windows 10.  
- **2025-05-06T07:28:55+00:00 [agent]:** Got it, thanks! Could you try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page to see if the issue persists? Also, can you share a screenshot of the affected images?  
- **2025-05-06T07:34:18+00:00 [customer]:** I cleared my cache and refreshed, but the issue is still there. Iâ€™ve attached a screenshot below showing the problem.  
- **2025-05-06T07:40:52+00:00 [agent]:** Thanks for the screenshot, Sarah. This appears to be related to how the frontend is rendering images. I'll escalate this to our engineering team to investigate further. In the meantime, you can try resizing your browser window to see if that temporarily resolves the issue.
