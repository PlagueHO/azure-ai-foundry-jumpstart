  - 2025-05-18T05:34:02Z [customer] We're getting a 500 error when trying to place orders through the checkout page. It started about 10 minutes ago, and now no one can complete a purchase. Can you look into this ASAP?  
  - 2025-05-18T05:36:19Z [agent] Hi Jordan, thank you for reporting this. Just to confirm, is this affecting all users or only certain accounts? Do you see the 500 error immediately on clicking "Place Order," or does it take a while? Any other error messages or codes in the browser console or server logs?
