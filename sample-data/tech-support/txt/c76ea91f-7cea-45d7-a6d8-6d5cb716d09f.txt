  - (2025-05-06T06:10:15+00:00) [customer] Hi, my staff are reporting that they can't process payments at checkout. The system shows an error saying "Payment Submission Failed. Please Retry." This is affecting all our locations.  
  - (2025-05-06T06:12:47+00:00) [agent] Hi John, thank you for bringing this to our attention. I understand the urgency of this issue. We'll investigate immediately and keep you updated. Can you confirm if this issue is happening for all payment methods or just specific ones?  
  - (2025-05-06T06:14:03+00:00) [customer] It seems to be happening for all payment methods. We’ve tried credit cards, debit cards, and even cash transactions. The error pops up regardless.  
  - (2025-05-06T06:16:21+00:00) [agent] Thanks for confirming. Based on the error message, this might be related to the frontend communicating with our backend payment API. Are you able to provide the exact error code displayed, if available?  
  - (2025-05-06T06:18:48+00:00) [customer] The error code shown is “ERR-PAYMENT-503.” Let me know if you need any further details.  
  - (2025-05-06T06:20:39+00:00) [agent] Got it, thank you. We’re pulling logs from both the frontend and backend services to identify the source of the issue. I’ll provide an update shortly.
