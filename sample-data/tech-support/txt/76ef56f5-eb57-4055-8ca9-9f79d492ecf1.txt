  Hi, we're seeing issues at all of our stores where the checkout process is not working. This is affecting all users across multiple locations.

  Hi Andrew, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We're sorry you're experiencing this issue. To confirm, is the checkout button unresponsive, or do you see an error message when trying to complete transactions?  

- **[2025-05-06T06:08:10+00:00] [customer]**  
  There's an error message: "Unable to process transaction. Please try again later." This happens every time we attempt to finalize a sale.
