  - 2025-05-18T05:34:10Z [customer] I'm seeing "Failed to fetch products" when loading the home page sometimes. Not every time, but it's happening more today.
  - 2025-05-18T06:02:44Z [agent] Thank you for reporting this, Jordan. Can you confirm if this occurs across different browsers or devices? Are there any other error details in the console or network logs?
  - 2025-05-18T06:15:21Z [customer] Happens in Chrome and Edge, both desktop and mobile. In the dev tools, I see a 502 Bad Gateway response from /api/products when it fails.
  - 2025-05-18T06:41:03Z [agent] Appreciate the details. We're investigating potential backend issues. Are you seeing any patterns, like time of day or specific product categories?
  - 2025-05-18T07:02:50Z [customer] No pattern I can see. Just random, sometimes reload fixes it.
  - 2025-05-18T08:12:14Z [agent] Thanks, Jordan. We've identified intermittent scaling issues on our Azure App Service causing brief outages. We're applying a fix and will monitor.
  - 2025-05-18T11:27:33Z [customer] Haven't seen the error in the last hour. Looks good now.
  - 2025-05-18T11:30:08Z [agent] Glad to hear it! We’ve increased App Service instance limits and adjusted auto-scaling rules. Please let us know if the issue returns.

Resolution: Scaling configuration for Azure App Service was updated to handle higher concurrent traffic, resolving intermittent 502 errors on the /api/products endpoint.  
Area: backend  
Is Bug: false  
Root Cause: Insufficient App Service scaling configuration led to backend API intermittently returning 502 errors during peak usage periods.
