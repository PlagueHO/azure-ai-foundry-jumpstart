  - 2025-05-18T05:33:02.691813+00:00 [customer] We're seeing a lot of failed checkouts since last night. Users get a 502 Bad Gateway when they try to place an order. Our ops dashboard shows API timeouts, but the site loads otherwise. Can you help ASAP?  
  - 2025-05-18T05:40:24.317413+00:00 [agent] Thank you for reaching out, Jordan. To help us investigate, could you provide the following:  
    - The approximate time the issue started  
    - Any recent deployments or configuration changes  
    - If the 502 occurs on all orders or only certain products/users  
    - A sample request ID or error log from your API gateway  

This information will help us pinpoint the cause quickly. Looking forward to your reply.
