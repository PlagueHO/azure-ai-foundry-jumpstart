- 2025-05-18T05:33:11Z [customer] We're getting a lot of "Failed to load products" messages on the home page since last night. Sometimes it loads after refreshing, but it's pretty inconsistent. Can you check what's going on?
- 2025-05-18T05:36:52Z [agent] Hi Janelle, thanks for reporting this. Can you confirm if all users are affected, or is it limited to certain locations or browsers? Also, do you see any error codes or messages in the browser console?
