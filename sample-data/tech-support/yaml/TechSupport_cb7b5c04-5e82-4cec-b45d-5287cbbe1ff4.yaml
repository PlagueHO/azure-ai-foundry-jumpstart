  message: 'We''ve identified increased latency and intermittent timeouts on the REST
    API, particularly during peak traffic. The backend SQL database shows some slow
    queries related to order processing. We''re optimizing those queries and scaling
    up the App Service instance as a mitigation.

  message: 'We''ve completed the query optimizations and scaled the backend. API performance
    is back to normal, and we''ve confirmed that affected orders were not committed
    to the database, so no partial transactions occurred. We''ll continue monitoring
    but you should see normal operation now.

resolution: 'Backend SQL query optimizations and increased Azure App Service scaling
  resolved the intermittent API timeouts. No lost or partial transactions were detected;
  checkout is now functioning normally.

is_bug: true
root_cause: Inefficient SQL queries under high concurrency caused backend API timeouts,
  impacting the checkout process during peak usage.
