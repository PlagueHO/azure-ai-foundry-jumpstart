  message: Hello, we've noticed that some of our product images are not loading on
    the main shop page. This doesn't seem to affect every product or every refresh,
    but it's inconsistent and is causing a poor user experience. Can you please investigate?

  message: Thank you for reporting this issue, Jordan. We'll start investigating the
    image loading problems on the storefront. Could you let us know if this affects
    certain products more than others, or if you have any relevant error messages
    or browser console logs?
