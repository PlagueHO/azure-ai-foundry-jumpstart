  message: Hello, we're seeing reports from several customers that when they place
    an order, it sometimes doesn't show up in their order history. The payment goes
    through, but the order isn't visible on the frontend and we can't find it in the
    admin dashboard either. Can you help us investigate this?

  message: Thank you for reaching out, Jordan. We're sorry to hear about this issue.
    To help us investigate, could you provide any recent order IDs or affected user
    accounts? Additionally, do you know if this is happening for all products or just
    specific ones?
