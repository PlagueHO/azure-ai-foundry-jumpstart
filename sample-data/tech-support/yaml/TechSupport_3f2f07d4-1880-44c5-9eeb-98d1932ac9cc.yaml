resolution: The Service Bus queue backlog was cleared and order processing resumed.
  The incident was traced to a scaling misconfiguration during peak load; auto-scaling
  parameters have been adjusted to prevent recurrence.
area: backend
is_bug: true
root_cause: Service Bus message processing was delayed due to insufficient scaling
  of the order processing worker, causing a backlog during high-traffic periods.
