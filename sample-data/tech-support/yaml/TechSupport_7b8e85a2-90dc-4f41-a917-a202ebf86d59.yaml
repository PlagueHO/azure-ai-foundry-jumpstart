  message: We're experiencing a high rate of checkout failures. Users are seeing a
    "Payment not processed" error after submitting their orders, but the payments
    are sometimes being captured anyway. This has led to confusion and some duplicate
    charges. Please investigate as soon as possible.

  message: Thank you for the details and logs. Our engineers have identified multiple
    timeout exceptions between the API and the Service Bus, causing duplicate payment
    processing attempts. We're deploying a fix to improve error handling and idempotency
    on the transaction endpoint.
  timestamp: 2025-05-18 05:33:39+00:00
- role: agent
  message: The hotfix has been deployed and monitoring confirms checkout transactions
    are now processing correctly. Please verify on your end and let us know if further
    issues occur.

    resolved. Thank you for your prompt assistance.

resolution: A hotfix was deployed to improve error handling and implement idempotency
  at the transaction endpoint, preventing duplicate payment processing when Service
  Bus timeouts occur. Monitoring confirms the checkout process is stable.
area: backend
is_bug: true
root_cause: Timeout exceptions between the API and Service Bus led to duplicate transaction
  attempts and inconsistent payment states due to insufficient idempotency in the
  transaction endpoint.
