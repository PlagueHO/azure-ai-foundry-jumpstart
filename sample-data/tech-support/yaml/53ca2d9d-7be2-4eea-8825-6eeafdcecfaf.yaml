  message: Thanks for bringing this to our attention, Michael. Are the delays happening
    at specific times of the day or with particular product categories?

- role: customer
  message: It seems random, but it mostly happens when we're busy, like during peak
    sales hours. No particular product categories are affected, just overall delays
    in loading.

  message: Got it. We'll start by checking the backend API performance logs and database
    query metrics during those peak hours. I'll update you shortly once we have more
    details.
