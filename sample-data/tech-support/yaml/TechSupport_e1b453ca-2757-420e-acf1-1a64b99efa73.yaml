  message: 'Since last night, all users are unable to complete purchases on our ContosoShop
    site. The checkout screen returns an "Unable to process payment" error after clicking
    "Place Order." We have confirmed the payment gateway is operational and suspect
    the issue may be within our API or transaction workflow. This is impacting all
    customers and needs urgent attention.
