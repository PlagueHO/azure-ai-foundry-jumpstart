  message: Thank you for reporting this, Sarah. Can you confirm if the issue is affecting
    all customers or only specific ones? Also, are there any error codes being shown?

    mentions a timeout, but some users reported seeing a '500 Internal Server Error.'

  message: "Understood. We\u2019ll start investigating potential backend issues right\
    \ away. Can you let us know if the front-end is behaving normally otherwise, or\
    \ if there are any visual glitches or slowdowns?"

- role: customer
  message: The front-end appears to be working fine. The issue seems isolated to transactions
    failing, which I assume is related to the backend APIs.
