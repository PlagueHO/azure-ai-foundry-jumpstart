  message: Hi Emily, thanks for reaching out. Could you confirm if this issue is affecting
    all your sales terminals or just specific ones?

  message: It seems to be affecting all of them. Our team tested on three different
    terminals and encountered the same issue.

  message: Understood. Are there specific times or transaction types that trigger
    the error, or does it happen randomly?
