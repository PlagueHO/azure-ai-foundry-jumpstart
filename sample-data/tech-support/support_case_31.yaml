  message: Hi Sandra, thanks for reaching out! Let me check the backend logs to see

  message: "I\u2019ve checked the logs, and it seems the query is taking longer than\
    \ expected due to high data volume. I recommend filtering by a smaller date range\
    \ or reducing the query complexity. Can you try that and let me know?"

  message: I tried filtering by week instead of the whole month, and it worked. Thanks
    for the suggestion!

  message: Glad to hear it worked! I'll escalate this internally to optimize the report
    generation process for larger datasets.
