problem_description: 'Users report that a previously accessible shared mailbox and
  its calendar have disappeared from Outlook (desktop and web) and mobile clients.
  The problem can be caused by revoked permissions, directory synchronization anomalies,
  license changes, or mailbox provisioning errors after tenant changes. This SOP covers
  validation steps in the admin portals, use of a read-only diagnostic PowerShell
  module, restoring permissions, forcing Outlook/OWA rebind, and verifying calendar
  sync across clients.

  '
symptoms:
- Shared mailbox no longer appears in Outlook desktop under 'Folders' or 'Shared Mailboxes'.
- Shared calendar events are missing for some or all users; calendar view shows empty
  or default.
- OWA does not list the shared mailbox in the left pane for affected users.
- Mobile clients show inconsistent calendar events or fail to open the shared mailbox.
- Affected users receive a 403/Access Denied error when trying to open the mailbox
  via OWA.
prerequisites:
- Tenant admin or delegated admin role with permission to manage Exchange Online and
  Azure AD groups.
- Affected user's username (UPN) and the shared mailbox SMTP address.
- Change window outside peak hours when possible.
required_tools:
- Access to Microsoft 365 admin center and Exchange admin center (EAC) via browser.
- Support workstation with the MS365AdminX diagnostic PowerShell module installed
  (fictional module used for SOP).
- Company-approved remote support tool for reproducing the issue on the user's client
  (if needed).
- Valid incident ticket in the ITSM system with user consent logged.
estimated_resolution_time: 15-45 minutes
resolution_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: Validate the scope and reproduce the issue.
  details: 'Confirm which users are impacted and whether the problem is client-specific
    (Outlook desktop, OWA, mobile). Ask the primary user to attempt to access the
    shared mailbox via OWA in an incognito/private browser session to rule out client
    cache issues.

    '
  warnings: Do not make permission changes before confirming scope; note all users
    for potential bulk remediation.
- step_number: 2
  action: Confirm mailbox existence and provisioning in the admin console.
  details: 'Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center -> Exchange admin center ->
    Shared mailboxes. Verify the shared mailbox object exists, is not soft-deleted,
    and shows a valid SMTP address and ''Provisioned'' status in the EAC object summary.

    '
  warnings: If mailbox is soft-deleted, stop and follow the recovery sub-procedure
    in escalation step if you are not authorized to restore deleted mailboxes.
- step_number: 3
  action: Check Azure AD group membership and mailbox access control.
  details: 'Open Azure AD -> Groups. If mailbox access is managed via an Azure AD
    security group (recommended pattern), confirm the group includes the affected
    users and that the group is not in a ''Pending'' or ''Sync error'' state.

    '
  warnings: Do not remove or re-add users into groups until you have recorded the
    current membership for audit.
- step_number: 4
  action: Run read-only diagnostic checks from support workstation.
  details: 'On the support workstation, open PowerShell and run the MS365AdminX diagnostic
    module to gather state. Example fictional commands: - Connect-MS365AdminX -TenantAlias
    contoso -Mode ReadOnly - Get-SharedMailboxInfoX -Identity sharedmailbox@contoso.local
    - Get-SharedMailboxAccessX -Identity sharedmailbox@contoso.local Collect the outputs
    into the incident ticket.

    '
  warnings: MS365AdminX is a diagnostic-only module in this SOP. Do not run hypothetical
    fix cmdlets unless step 6 authorizes modification.
- step_number: 5
  action: Verify direct mailbox permissions in Exchange.
  details: 'In EAC, open the shared mailbox > Mailbox Delegation. Check ''Full Access''
    and ''Send As'' lists to ensure the affected users are present. If they are missing
    but group membership is correct, continue to step 6 to reapply delegated permissions
    via group rebind.

    '
- step_number: 6
  action: Reapply or rebind permissions (non-destructive).
  details: 'If permissions are missing or inconsistent, rebind them using the following
    controlled approach: - If permissions were assigned directly to users: add the
    affected user back to ''Full Access'' with a comment in the audit. - If permissions
    were assigned via an Azure AD group: remove the group from Mailbox Delegation,
    wait 60 seconds, then re-add the group to force a policy rebind. - Use the MS365AdminX
    module only to schedule a non-destructive permission rebind: Schedule-MailboxRebindX
    -Identity sharedmailbox@contoso.local -Mode Gentle

    '
  warnings: Rebinding permissions can briefly affect existing access. Notify users
    if a small outage is expected.
- step_number: 7
  action: Force client re-index and profile rebind on Outlook desktop and OWA.
  details: 'Ask affected users to: - Close Outlook. - Clear local cache for the account
    (Outlook: remove and re-add the mailbox as a shared mailbox in profile or switch
    to Auto-Mapped behavior per company policy). - For Outlook Web Access, have the
    user sign out, clear cookies for the tenant domain, and sign back in. Optionally,
    use remote support to perform the steps if the user cannot.

    '
  warnings: Do not delete the entire Outlook profile unless necessary; prefer removing
    only the shared mailbox entry.
- step_number: 8
  action: Verify mobile client behavior.
  details: 'If the user uses native mobile apps, ensure the mobile account sync settings
    include shared calendars and that the app is updated to the latest approved version.
    If necessary, remove the tenant account from the mobile mail app and re-add it.

    '
  warnings: Inform users that re-adding the account may take time to resync calendars
    depending on data volume.
- step_number: 9
  action: Check licensing and mailbox type.
  details: 'Confirm the shared mailbox has not been inadvertently converted to a user
    mailbox or had its license changed to a type that disables shared mailbox behavior.
    If converted, follow company policy to restore shared mailbox type (record change
    and approval).

    '
  warnings: Any conversion carries risk of data movement; follow change control and
    backup procedures.
- step_number: 10
  action: Verify replication and background services.
  details: 'Use the diagnostic module to check background sync states: - Get-MailboxReplicationStatusX
    -Identity sharedmailbox@contoso.local If replication or indexing shows queued
    or failed jobs, note timestamps and escalate if persistent for >30 minutes.

    '
  warnings: Avoid initiating forced replication repair unless instructed by escalation
    path.
- step_number: 11
  action: Communicate resolution and document changes.
  details: 'Update the incident ticket with actions taken, before/after diagnostic
    outputs, and notify affected users with a short summary and any user actions required
    (e.g., re-open Outlook).

    '
- step_number: 12
  action: Close the ticket after verification and monitoring window.
  details: 'Keep ticket in Monitoring state for 1 hour to confirm stability across
    multiple clients and time zones before full closure.

    '
verification_steps:
- User confirms shared mailbox appears in Outlook desktop and OWA and can open folders
  without 403 errors.
- Affected users can view and create events in the shared calendar; new events propagate
  to other users within 10 minutes.
- 'PowerShell diagnostic outputs show ''AccessState: Healthy'' and no pending replication
  jobs for the shared mailbox.'
- No re-occurrence reported in monitoring window (1 hour).
troubleshooting:
- issue: Permissions re-added but mailbox still inaccessible for some users.
  solution: Confirm user's primary SMTP/UPN hasn't changed; if it has, re-add using
    the current UPN. Clear local Outlook cached credentials. If issue persists, obtain
    Fiddler/Network logs with user consent to check authentication token errors.
- issue: Shared calendar events missing for a subset of users.
  solution: Check calendar folder permissions explicitly and confirm delegated calendar
    view settings. Ensure clients are not filtering by category/date. Ask affected
    users to perform a manual calendar sync or re-subscribe to the shared calendar
    view.
- issue: Rebind produced transient 'Access Denied' for all members.
  solution: Rollback by re-adding original settings if recorded. Open an incident
    with the platform team and provide pre/post snapshots from diagnostic module for
    rollback guidance.
- issue: Soft-deleted mailbox discovered.
  solution: Do NOT restore without approval. Escalate per escalation path for mailbox
    recovery following retention and legal hold checks.
escalation:
  condition: Issue not resolved after completion of resolution steps or replication/indexing
    shows persistent failures >30 minutes, or mailbox is soft-deleted.
  contact: Platform Engineering - Exchange Team (on-call)
  escalation_path: '1) Open a P1 incident and include diagnostic outputs, affected
    user list, timestamps, and any governance approvals. 2) Notify Platform Engineering
    via the on-call rotation and attach the incident ticket. 3) If Platform Engineering
    cannot resolve within 60 minutes, escalate to Azure AD directory team and provide
    logs for cross-team triage.
