problem_description: 'One or more hot-swap drive bays are not detected by the RAID
  controller or the system shows a failed backplane event in iDRAC/BIOS. This SOP
  covers safe identification, removal and replacement of a faulty hot-swap drive backplane
  (drive cage assembly) on Dell PowerEdge 14th-generation servers (common examples:
  R640, R740, R740xd) and verification that the controller and OS re-recognize drives
  and begin or continue rebuilds. This document assumes a failed backplane (electrical
  or midplane failure) rather than individual drive failures.

  '
symptoms:
- iDRAC hardware log reports 'Backplane failure' or 'SAS expander error'
- One or more drive bay LEDs remain amber or unlit while drives tested good
- OS shows missing disks / degraded RAID after multiple drives appear offline
- System event log (SEL) contains repetitive SAS or enclosure errors
prerequisites:
- Confirmed system model is within supported family (R640/R740/R740xd) and chassis
  supports replaceable backplane
- Validated part replacement is the correct FRU for this chassis and drive bay count
- Current full backup or verified RAID redundancy in place (do not assume RAID integrity)
- Change window scheduled and A/V personnel notified if required by site policy
- On-site technical staff certified for simple server hardware replacements
required_tools:
- ESD wrist strap and ESD-safe work area
- T10 and T15 Torx drivers, Phillips screwdriver
- Antistatic bag for removed components
- iDRAC (network) access credentials with administrator privileges
- Lifecycle Controller / Dell OMSA access (for pre/post checks)
- Replacement backplane FRU (field replacement unit) and any required bezel/cable
  kit
- SAS cable and connector retention clips (spares recommended)
estimated_resolution_time: 45-90 minutes (excluding part delivery time)
resolution_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: Confirm failure and capture baseline logs
  details: 'Access iDRAC (web UI) and capture the Hardware Logs (Lifecycle Logs).
    Document PERC controller output (via iDRAC RACADM or OMSA): run ''omreport storage
    controller'' and ''omreport storage pdisk controller=0'' or equivalent. Note which
    bay numbers are reported as offline. Export logs to the ticket before proceeding.

    '
  warnings: Do not proceed with hardware removal if RAID rebuilds are active without
    confirmed redundancy plan.
- step_number: 2
  action: Notify stakeholders and schedule brief outage
  details: 'Inform application owners and any monitoring teams. Place server in maintenance
    mode in monitoring systems if necessary. Record maintenance window start time
    in the ticket.

    '
- step_number: 3
  action: 'Pre-check: Safe-drive removal and data protection'
  details: 'If any drive shows as ''hot spare'' or ''rebuilding'', pause and consider
    postponing physical work unless replacement is urgent. If required, gracefully
    evacuate virtual machines or migrate services. Take a last known-good configuration
    backup (controller config export).

    '
  warnings: Removal without confirming redundancy may cause permanent data loss.
- step_number: 4
  action: Powering down the server (if recommended by FRU instructions)
  details: 'If the FRU instructions recommend a cold service, shut down OS gracefully.
    Use iDRAC to perform a graceful shutdown: ''Power -> Graceful Shutdown''. Confirm
    AC power is removed from server before opening chassis.

    '
  warnings: If chassis and backplane support hot-swap replacement without power-off,
    consult FRU note. When in doubt, power off.
- step_number: 5
  action: Remove front bezel and drive carriers
  details: 'Unlock and remove the front bezel if installed. Label and remove all populated
    drive carriers from the affected bay range. Place drives in antistatic bags in
    bay order to preserve slot mapping.

    '
- step_number: 6
  action: Disconnect backplane power and SAS connectors
  details: 'Identify the backplane assembly connectors (power + SAS/midplane cable).
    Unplug connectors using proper release tabs; avoid pulling on wires. If a support
    cage or cable bracket secures the connectors, remove its fasteners.

    '
  warnings: Document connector orientation; do not force connectors or pry release
    latches.
- step_number: 7
  action: Remove the backplane assembly
  details: 'Remove the screws/retainers securing the backplane. Carefully slide the
    backplane out of the chassis. Inspect mating surfaces and cable ends for debris,
    bent pins, or burn marks. Photograph assembly for ticket record.

    '
- step_number: 8
  action: Install replacement backplane FRU
  details: 'Unpack the replacement FRU in ESD-safe conditions. Install in reverse
    of removal. Secure with original screws, reconnect SAS/power connectors until
    fully seated, and re-attach any retention brackets. Reinstall drive carriers.

    '
  warnings: Validate FRU part number against the ticket and chassis documentation
    before installing.
- step_number: 9
  action: Power on server and monitor POST/iDRAC
  details: 'Reconnect AC power and power on. Monitor POST messages and iDRAC system
    event log for any immediate errors. Enter Lifecycle Controller if prompted to
    run a quick hardware scan.

    '
- step_number: 10
  action: Verify RAID controller and OS recognition
  details: 'Use iDRAC/OMSA to verify the controller recognizes all drives. Commands:
    ''omreport storage controller'' and ''omreport storage pdisk'' (or iDRAC web UI).
    Confirm that any degraded arrays begin rebuilding automatically. If rebuild does
    not start, import foreign configuration per controller guidance.

    '
- step_number: 11
  action: Restore normal operations and update ticket
  details: 'After verification, remove maintenance mode, notify stakeholders, and
    attach all collected logs and photographs to the service ticket. Return removed
    drives to their original bay order if not previously re-seated.

    '
verification_steps:
- step: iDRAC event logs show backplane replaced and no new critical errors
- step: OMSA (or PERC GUI) lists all physical disks as 'Online' or 'Rebuilding' as
    expected
- step: All front-panel drive bay LEDs show green/blue per vendor spec (no steady
    amber)
- step: Operating system sees all logical volumes and expected storage capacity
- step: Controller rebuilds (if any) complete to 100% without further hardware errors
troubleshooting:
- issue: Drives not recognized after replacement
  solution: 'Confirm SAS connector seating; power-cycle and reseat connectors. Check
    midplane cable orientation (mirror keyed). Review iDRAC SEL for additional error
    codes. If controller shows ''foreign configuration'', import via PERC GUI only
    if you are certain it''s the original configuration.

    '
- issue: Controller reports mismatched backplane FRU or firmware mismatch
  solution: 'Check FRU sticker and firmware revision. If firmware mismatch, download
    recommended backplane firmware bundle to Lifecycle Controller and update firmware
    per vendor guidance. If FRU incorrect, replace with correct part.

    '
- issue: LEDs remain amber/alert persists
  solution: 'Re-run diagnostics in Lifecycle Controller (hardware diagnostics). Swap
    in known-good SAS/power cable from another chassis to isolate cable vs backplane.

    '
- issue: Rebuilds fail with multiple disk errors
  solution: 'Pause, verify backups and escalate to storage engineering. Collect HDD
    SMART data (''omreport storage pdisk'') and attach to ticket. Consider cloning
    failed drives to preserve data state.

    '
escalation:
  condition: Any persistent critical hardware error in iDRAC after replacement, multiple
    drive failures during rebuild, or inability to identify compatible FRU
  contact: 'Hardware Support Lead: ops-hardware-lead@example-tech.internal, +1-555-0199
    (internal)'
  escalation_path: '1) Contact on-site vendor NOC for immediate RMA validation and
    part swap confirmation. 2) If NOC cannot resolve, escalate to Hardware Engineering
    (hw-eng@example-tech.internal). 3) If data integrity at risk, engage Storage Engineering
    and Data Recovery teams per DRP.
