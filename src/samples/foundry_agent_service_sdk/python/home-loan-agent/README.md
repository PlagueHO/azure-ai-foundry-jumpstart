**üîß Agent Response**: Code Interpreter performs mortgage payment calculation.

---

**User**: What documents do I need for a Contoso Bank loan?  
**üîç Agent Response**: File Search Tool retrieves the Contoso Bank loan documentation checklist.

---

**User**: Can you compare the estimated closing costs for FHA and Conventional loans at Contoso Bank?  
**üîç Agent Response**: File Search Tool retrieves rows from the dataset for side-by-side cost comparison.

---

**User**: I‚Äôm comparing a 15-year and 30-year mortgage‚Äîcan you show the difference in total interest paid?  
**üîß Agent Response**: Code Interpreter compares amortization scenarios.

---

**User**: I have a condo in Florida‚Äîwhat loan products allow condos, and what are their DTI limits?  
**üîç Agent Response**: File Search Tool returns products where `Allowed Property Types = Condo`, with associated DTI caps.

## üõ† Customization Tips

- **Integrate with Loan Origination Systems (LOS)**  
  Add a custom tool or connector (e.g., via Azure Logic Apps) to allow users to submit pre-approval applications, upload documents, or retrieve loan status from internal LOS platforms.

- **Personalize Based on User Profile**  
  Modify the `system_message` to adjust tone and guidance for first-time buyers, military veterans, or investment property seekers.

- **Enable Secure Document Submission**  
  Extend the agent to support Azure Blob or SharePoint uploads for income verification, ID, or bank statements, and validate them using metadata or form templates.

- **Visualize Loan Comparisons**  
  Generate charts comparing monthly payments, total interest, and amortization curves across loan products.

- **Add Multi-language Support**  
  Integrate Translator or prompt-based language switching to support users in multiple languages.

## üìã What the Sample Does

The `home_loan_agent.py` script demonstrates a complete agent lifecycle with the following process:

### 1. **Connection & Authentication**

- Establishes connection to Azure AI Foundry using `DefaultAzureCredential`
- Tests the connection before proceeding
- Uses environment variables for configuration

### 2. **File Upload & Preparation**

- Uploads `Contoso_Loan_Documentation_Checklist.md` for document search capabilities
- Uploads `loan_product_eligibility_dataset.csv` for code interpreter analysis
- Creates a vector store with the checklist file for enhanced search

### 3. **Agent Creation**

- Creates a "home-loan-guide" agent with comprehensive mortgage expertise
- Configures the agent with detailed instructions covering:
  - Mortgage application guidance
  - Document preparation assistance
  - Loan option evaluation
  - Credit score insights
  - Payment structure explanations

### 4. **Tool Configuration**

- **File Search Tool**: Configured with the vector store for document retrieval
- **Code Interpreter Tool**: Set up with the loan dataset for calculations and analysis

### 5. **Conversation Execution**

- Creates a conversation thread
- Accepts questions via command-line parameters or interactive input
- Default question: "What documents do I need for a Contoso Bank loan?"
- Processes the agent's response using both tools
- Displays the complete conversation history

### 6. **Resource Cleanup**

- Deletes the vector store
- Removes uploaded files
- Deletes the created agent
- Ensures no resources are left behind

### üìä Sample Output

When you run the script, you'll see:

- Connection status and agent creation confirmations
- File upload progress with generated IDs
- Vector store creation details
- The question being asked (custom or default)
- The complete conversation between user and agent
