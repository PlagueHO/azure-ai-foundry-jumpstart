## üìã What the Sample Does

The `home_loan_agent.py` script demonstrates a complete agent lifecycle with modular resource management and the following process:

### 1. **Connection & Authentication**

- Establishes connection to Azure AI Foundry using `DefaultAzureCredential`
- Tests the connection before proceeding
- Uses environment variables for configuration

### 2. **File Upload & Preparation**

- Uploads `Contoso_Loan_Documentation_Checklist.md` for document search capabilities
- Uploads `loan_product_eligibility_dataset.csv` for code interpreter analysis
- Creates a vector store with the checklist file for enhanced search

### 3. **Agent Creation**

- Creates a "home-loan-guide" agent with comprehensive mortgage expertise
- Configures the agent with detailed instructions covering:
  - Mortgage application guidance
  - Document preparation assistance
  - Loan option evaluation
  - Credit score insights
  - Payment structure explanations

### 4. **Tool Configuration**

- **File Search Tool**: Configured with the vector store for document retrieval
- **Code Interpreter Tool**: Set up with the loan dataset for calculations and analysis

### 5. **Thread Management**

- **Single Question Mode**: Creates a dedicated thread for each question session
- **Interactive Mode**: Creates a persistent thread that maintains conversation context
- Dedicated `create_thread()` and `delete_thread()` functions for proper lifecycle management

### 6. **Conversation Execution**

- Accepts questions via command-line parameters or interactive input
- Default question: "What documents do I need for a Contoso Bank loan?"
- Processes the agent's response using both tools
- Displays the complete conversation history with proper message ordering

### 7. **Resource Cleanup**

- **Thread Cleanup**: Properly deletes conversation threads when sessions end
- **Agent Cleanup**: Removes the agent and associated resources
- **File Cleanup**: Deletes uploaded files and vector stores
- Ensures no resources are left behind with proper error handling

### üìä Sample Output

When you run the script, you'll see:

- Connection status and agent creation confirmations
- File upload progress with generated IDs
- Vector store creation details
- **Thread creation and management**: Clear indication of thread lifecycle
- The question being asked (custom or default)
- The complete conversation between user and agent
- Step-by-step resource cleanup including thread deletion

### üí° Architecture Highlights

The script follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Agent Management**: `create_agent()` and `cleanup_agent()` handle agent lifecycle
- **Thread Management**: `create_thread()` and `delete_thread()` manage conversation contexts
- **Question Processing**: `ask_question()` handles individual interactions
- **Session Management**: `process_question()` and `interactive_mode()` orchestrate complete workflows

### üîÑ Architecture Overview

#### Modular Resource Management

```text
1. Create agent + resources
2. Create dedicated thread
3. Process question
4. Delete thread
5. Cleanup agent + resources
```

#### Interactive Session Architecture

```text
1. Create agent + resources
2. Create persistent thread
3. Process multiple questions (same thread)
4. Delete thread on exit
5. Cleanup agent + resources
```

### üí¨ Usage Examples

#### Single Question Mode

```bash
# Use the default question
python home_loan_agent.py

# Ask a specific question
python home_loan_agent.py -q "What are the interest rates for FHA loans?"

# Ask about calculations
python home_loan_agent.py --question "Calculate monthly payment for $350,000 loan at 6.2% for 10, 20 and 30 years."
```

Each single question creates its own isolated session with dedicated thread management.

#### Interactive Session Mode

```bash
python home_loan_agent.py --interactive
```

In interactive mode, you can:

- Ask multiple questions in sequence within the **same conversation thread**
- The agent maintains conversation context between questions
- Reference previous questions and build upon earlier responses
- Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'q' to stop
- The agent and conversation thread persist throughout the entire session

**Example Interactive Session:**

```text
Your question: What documents do I need for a conventional loan?
[Agent provides document checklist...]

Your question: Can you calculate payments for a $400,000 loan with those requirements?
[Agent references previous context and performs calculations...]

Your question: What if I put down 25% instead of 20%?
[Agent builds on previous calculation context...]
```
