# Initiative Analyzer Specification

A Python-based command-line tool that leverages Azure AI Foundry to analyze CSV backlog items against organizational initiatives, generating strategic alignment reports and recommendations.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The Initiative Analyzer provides automated semantic analysis of product backlog items against organizational strategic initiatives using Azure AI Foundry's language models. The tool processes CSV data files to generate comprehensive markdown reports showing how backlog work supports strategic goals, enabling data-driven prioritization decisions.

**Target Audience**: Product managers, engineering teams, strategic planners, and project stakeholders
**Assumptions**: Users have access to Azure AI Foundry, understand CSV data formats, and require strategic backlog analysis

## 2. Definitions

- **AI Foundry**: Azure AI Foundry service providing language model capabilities
- **Backlog Item**: Individual work item with category, title, goal, and stream metadata
- **Initiative**: Organizational strategic goal with area, description, KPIs, and solutions
- **Confidence Score**: AI-generated percentage (0-100) indicating association strength
- **Chunking**: Batching backlog items for efficient API processing
- **Item-Centric**: Legacy processing mode analyzing each backlog item individually
- **Initiative-Centric**: Optimized processing mode analyzing batches per initiative
- **Association**: Semantic link between backlog item and initiative with confidence score
- **Enriched Item**: Backlog item enhanced with AI analysis and recommendations

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

## 7. Rationale & Context

The Initiative Analyzer addresses the challenge of aligning product backlog work with strategic organizational initiatives. Traditional manual analysis is time-consuming and subjective, while this tool provides:

1. **Objective Analysis**: AI-powered semantic matching reduces human bias
2. **Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces API costs and processing time
3. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets that would be impractical for manual review
4. **Consistency**: Standardized confidence scoring and reporting format
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple processing modes and filtering options for different use cases

The initiative-centric processing mode was implemented to address API efficiency concerns, reducing calls from O(n) to O(n/chunk_size Ã— m) where n is backlog items and m is initiatives.
